AI-SDLC is an open-source framework for running AI coding agents autonomously through the full software development lifecycle. It goes beyond individual agent calls: it orchestrates agent dispatch, enforces cross-harness review independence, guides operators through definition-of-ready decisions, and provides a live TUI for monitoring the entire pipeline — all with quality gates and provenance at every step.

The framework takes issues as input and routes them through a declared pipeline: tasks are prioritized, agents are dispatched into isolated worktrees, three independent reviewers (optionally across different AI harnesses) validate the work, DSSE attestation envelopes are signed, and pull requests are opened — with the operator monitoring progress from a dashboard rather than managing individual steps.

Governance is a first-class pillar, not an afterthought. Declarative policies define which actions agents can take, which paths they can write, and what quality gates must pass before a PR is mergeable. The orchestrator enforces these policies at every stage, recording outcomes in an autonomy ledger that determines how much trust each agent has earned.

---

## What is this?

AI-SDLC is a **full autonomous SDLC framework** shipped in the May 2026 sprint. The framework comprises six shipped pillars:

### Autonomous Orchestrator ([RFC-0015](spec/rfcs/RFC-0015-autonomous-pipeline-orchestrator.md))

`cli-orchestrator tick` / `cli-orchestrator start` runs a continuous reconciliation loop over your backlog. Each tick:

- Reads the dependency graph and admission filters (blocked, already-in-flight, DoR, dispatchability)
- Dispatches admitted tasks into isolated git worktrees (Pattern C layout)
- Runs the full Step 0-13 pipeline: dev agent → 3 reviewers → attestation sign → PR open
- Applies a worktree mutex to prevent `.git/config.lock` races on parallel dispatches
- Quarantines failed branches and reverts task status for clean retry
- Resumes interrupted tasks from checkpoint commits rather than restarting from scratch

Feature flag: `AI_SDLC_AUTONOMOUS_ORCHESTRATOR=experimental`

Operator runbooks: [`docs/operations/orchestrator-runbook.md`](docs/operations/orchestrator-runbook.md) | [`docs/operations/orchestrator-promotion.md`](docs/operations/orchestrator-promotion.md)

### Cross-Harness Review ([RFC-0010](spec/rfcs/RFC-0010-parallel-execution-worktree-pooling.md) §13)

Claude and Codex review each other's work. A Claude-developed PR is reviewed by Codex (`code-reviewer-codex`, `test-reviewer-codex`); a Codex-developed PR is reviewed by Claude's standard reviewers. Security always runs on Claude Opus.

- DSSE envelopes carry a `harness` field that identifies which execution harness produced each review
- `verify-attestation` enforces independence: if the implementer was Codex, the code and test reviewers must use a different harness
- Verifier accepts `code-reviewer-codex` and `test-reviewer-codex` as satisfying the required reviewer set — no redundant Claude review needed

Runbook: [`docs/operations/cross-harness-review.md`](docs/operations/cross-harness-review.md)

### Decision Engine ([RFC-0011](spec/rfcs/RFC-0011-definition-of-ready-gate.md) DoR)

Tasks are not dispatched until they satisfy a Definition of Ready gate. The DoR check:

- Validates that acceptance criteria are present and unambiguous
- Scores complexity and checks that task scope is bounded
- Blocks dispatch on tasks that lack operator-answered questions (frontload decisions before the agent runs)

Feature flag: `AI_SDLC_DOR_GATE` | Runbook: [`docs/operations/dor-promotion.md`](docs/operations/dor-promotion.md)

### Operator TUI ([RFC-0023](spec/rfcs/RFC-0023-operator-tui-pipeline-monitoring.md))

A live terminal dashboard with five panes: pipeline status, open PRs, dependency graph, configuration, and analytics. Launch with:

```bash
AI_SDLC_TUI=experimental node pipeline-cli/bin/cli-tui.mjs
# or:
ai-sdlc dashboard
```

### Pattern-C Worktree Isolation

The parent repository's working tree is read-only. Each dispatched task runs in its own isolated worktree at `.worktrees/<task-id>/`. MCP routing ensures writes land in the correct worktree, never as untracked debris in the parent. The plugin's MCP server resolves the active worktree from `AI_SDLC_ACTIVE_TASK_ID` or the per-worktree `.active-task` sentinel.

### Governance (original pillar)

Declarative agent-role policies, pre-push quality gates, DSSE attestation envelopes, branch protection enforcement, and an autonomy ledger that tracks each agent's trust level. Governance is now embedded in the orchestrator's admission and dispatch pipeline rather than being a standalone plugin concern.

---

## The Problem

AI agents can build small greenfield projects, but software falls apart as it grows. Technical debt compounds, complexity overwhelms context windows, and developer velocity collapses:

- **Productivity paradox**: Experienced developers using AI tools are 19% slower on mature codebases, despite believing they are 20% faster (METR 2025)
- **Quality decline**: Refactoring dropped from 25% to 10% of changes; code churn rose from 5.5% to 7.9% (Gitclear 2024)
- **Stability regression**: Every 25% increase in AI adoption correlates with 7.2% drop in system stability (Google DORA)
- **Trust gap**: Only 3% of developers express high trust in AI output (Stack Overflow 2025)

The root cause isn't that AI agents write bad code. It's that **nobody orchestrates how they work as the codebase grows.**

## How It Works

The orchestrator implements a continuous reconciliation loop:

```
1. WATCH    — Listen for triggers (issue assigned, CI failed, schedule)
2. ASSESS   — Analyze codebase complexity, score task complexity (1-10)
3. ROUTE    — Select strategy: fully-autonomous / AI-with-review / human-led
4. EXECUTE  — Invoke agent with context, constraints, and sandbox
5. VALIDATE — Run quality gates (tests, coverage, security, lint)
6. DELIVER  — Create PR with provenance, request review if required
7. LEARN    — Record outcome, update autonomy level, store episodic memory
```

```

## Getting Started (Adopter Flow)

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
# Add the AI-SDLC marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ai-sdlc-framework/ai-sdlc

# Install the plugin
/plugin install ai-sdlc@ai-sdlc

# Reload to activate
/reload-plugins
```

Or install the orchestrator CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @ai-sdlc/orchestrator
```

### 2. Initialize your repository

```bash
# Interactive bootstrap (recommended for first-time users)
ai-sdlc init

# Non-interactive (CI / scripted setup)
ai-sdlc init --yes
```

The `init` command scaffolds `.ai-sdlc/pipeline.yaml`, `agent-role.yaml`, `quality-gate.yaml`, `autonomy-policy.yaml`, the `ai-sdlc/pr-ready` rollup gate workflow, and a `CLAUDE.md` pointer block. Full flag reference: [`docs/operations/init.md`](docs/operations/init.md).

### 3. Dispatch your first task

```bash
# Single task via the slash command (subscription billing)
/ai-sdlc execute AISDLC-42

# Or run a pipeline for a single issue directly
ai-sdlc run --issue 42

# Or start the autonomous orchestrator (processes the full backlog)
AI_SDLC_AUTONOMOUS_ORCHESTRATOR=experimental ai-sdlc start
```

The pipeline runs Steps 0-13: sweep stale worktrees → triage → DoR check → worktree setup → developer agent → parallel reviewers → verdict aggregation → attestation sign → push + PR open → sibling-repo PRs → cleanup.

### 4. Enable cross-harness review (optional)

When Codex CLI is available (`which codex`), the orchestrator can route code and test reviews to Codex for independent harness coverage:

```bash
# Verify Codex availability
codex --version
codex login --check

# Spawn Codex reviewer subagents explicitly
Agent(subagent_type='ai-sdlc:code-reviewer-codex')
Agent(subagent_type='ai-sdlc:test-reviewer-codex')
```

Full setup and pilot procedure: [`docs/operations/cross-harness-review.md`](docs/operations/cross-harness-review.md).

> **Note:** The `/ai-sdlc init` adopter scaffold (`AISDLC-245` family) is currently in-flight. The manual flow above is the supported path today. The scaffold will automate steps 1-2 when it ships.

---

## Agent Runners

The orchestrator is **agent-agnostic**. It invokes AI coding agents through a standard `AgentRunner` interface:

| Runner | CLI Command | Auth Env Var | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ClaudeCodeRunner** | `claude -p` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude Code CLI in `--print` mode |
| **ClaudeCodeSdkRunner** | Agent SDK `query()` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude Code Agent SDK with budget caps, tool filtering, governance injection |
| **CopilotRunner** | `copilot -p --yolo` | `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Copilot CLI in autonomous mode |
| **CursorRunner** | `cursor-agent --print` | `CURSOR_API_KEY` | Cursor CLI with stream-json output |
| **CodexRunner** | `codex exec -` | `CODEX_API_KEY` | OpenAI Codex CLI via stdin |
| **GenericLLMRunner** | HTTP API | `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `LLM_API_KEY` | Any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint |

All runners support [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) sandbox isolation. When configured, agents execute inside kernel-level sandboxes with Landlock filesystem policies, seccomp syscall filtering, and network policy enforcement — without any changes to the agent itself.

Runners are auto-discovered from environment variables. Set the auth token and the runner becomes available:

```bash
export GH_TOKEN=ghp_...           # Enables CopilotRunner
export CURSOR_API_KEY=cur_...     # Enables CursorRunner
export CODEX_API_KEY=cdx_...      # Enables CodexRunner
```

All runners follow the same pattern: build prompt with codebase context, spawn the CLI, collect output, run `git diff` for changed files, stage and commit.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `ai-sdlc init` | Scaffold `.ai-sdlc/` config for your project |
| `ai-sdlc run --issue N` | Run pipeline for a single issue |
| `ai-sdlc start` | Start long-running orchestrator (watch mode) |
| `ai-sdlc status [ISSUE]` | Pipeline progress and recent runs |
| `ai-sdlc health` | Orchestrator health check |
| `ai-sdlc agents [NAME]` | Agent roster with autonomy levels |
| `ai-sdlc routing --last 7d` | Task routing distribution |
| `ai-sdlc complexity` | Codebase complexity profile |
| `ai-sdlc cost --last 7d` | Cost summary by agent and pipeline |
| `ai-sdlc dashboard` | Live TUI dashboard (RFC-0023) |
| `ai-sdlc detect-patterns` | Detect workflow patterns from telemetry data |
| `ai-sdlc list-patterns` | View detected patterns and proposals |
| `ai-sdlc approve-pattern ID` | Generate automation artifact from approved pattern |

## Codebase Intelligence

The orchestrator maintains persistent knowledge about your codebase that agents can't:

- **Complexity analysis** — File count, module structure, dependency graph, overall complexity score (1-10)
- **Architectural patterns** — Detects hexagonal, layered, event-driven patterns and enforces conformance
- **Hotspot identification** — Git history analysis for high-churn, high-complexity files that get extra scrutiny
- **Convention detection** — Naming patterns, test structure, import style injected as agent context
- **Episodic memory** — Records successes, failures, and regressions so agents learn from history
- **Workflow pattern detection** — Observes human-AI interaction sequences across sessions, mines repeated patterns via n-gram analysis, and proposes deterministic automations (commands, skills, hooks, workflows)

## Progressive Autonomy

Agents earn trust through demonstrated competence:

| Level | Name | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Intern | Read-only, suggestions only |
| 1 | Junior | Can make changes, all PRs require human review |
| 2 | Senior | Can auto-merge low-complexity PRs |
| 3 | Principal | Can handle complex tasks with minimal oversight |

Promotion requires meeting quantitative criteria (PR approval rate, rollback rate, security incidents) plus time-at-level minimums. Demotion is immediate on security incidents.

## Claude Code Plugin

Install the AI-SDLC governance plugin for zero-config enforcement in Claude Code:

```bash
# Add the AI-SDLC marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ai-sdlc-framework/ai-sdlc

# Install the plugin
/plugin install ai-sdlc@ai-sdlc

# Reload to activate
/reload-plugins
```

The plugin provides:

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| **7 Hooks** | PreToolUse enforcement, PostToolUse telemetry, SessionStart governance context + plugin-version staleness nag, Stop quality gates (command + agent + asyncRewake coverage), PermissionRequest deny |
| **6 Commands** | `/review`, `/triage`, `/fix-pr`, `/detect-patterns`, `/status`, `/version` |
| **3 Agents** | `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `test-reviewer` — each with restricted tool pools (reviewers can't Edit/Write) |
| **2 Cross-harness agents** | `code-reviewer-codex`, `test-reviewer-codex` — Codex-based reviewers for Claude-developed PRs |
| **1 Skill** | Governance rules auto-loaded at session start |
| **MCP Server** | 5 tools: `check_pr_status`, `check_issue`, `get_governance_context`, `list_detected_patterns`, `get_review_policy` |

### Staying up to date

Claude Code plugins don't auto-update — once installed, your bundled version
stays put until you explicitly run `/plugin update <name>`. To make sure that
gap doesn't silently swallow new features (the same way it once cost a
30-minute diagnosis loop when `execute-orchestrator` shipped in v0.8.0 against
a v0.7.0 install), the plugin includes a SessionStart staleness check
(AISDLC-89):

- Every Claude Code session start, the plugin fetches `marketplace.json` from
  `main` on this repo and compares the published version to the bundled one.
- When the bundled version is older, you see a one-line yellow banner on
  stderr telling you which version is available and how to update:

  ```
  ⚠ ai-sdlc plugin v0.7.0 installed, v0.8.1 available.
    Run: /plugin update ai-sdlc && /reload-plugins
    Changelog: https://github.com/ai-sdlc-framework/ai-sdlc/releases
  ```

- Result is cached for 24h at `~/.cache/ai-sdlc-plugin/version-check.json`,
  so subsequent session starts within a day skip the network call.
- **Silent on every failure mode** — offline, GitHub rate-limited, malformed
  JSON, anything else: the hook exits 0 and the session proceeds normally.
  No spam, no blocked startup.

To run the check on demand (bypassing the cache), use `/ai-sdlc version`. It
prints installed / latest / last-checked / status as a structured block.

To opt out entirely, set `AI_SDLC_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1` in your shell —
the SessionStart hook short-circuits immediately and `/ai-sdlc version`
prints `disabled` instead of querying the marketplace.

The SDK runner (`ClaudeCodeSdkRunner`) provides programmatic control over agents:

```typescript
import { ClaudeCodeSdkRunner } from '@ai-sdlc/orchestrator';

// Fine-grained agent control via the Agent SDK
const runner = new ClaudeCodeSdkRunner();
await runner.run({
  // ... context
  constraints: {
    maxBudgetUsd: 5.00,     // Hard cost ceiling
    maxTurns: 100,           // Turn limit
    blockedActions: ['gh pr merge*'],
    // ...
  },
});
```

Parallel reviews with per-reviewer tool restrictions and budget caps:

```typescript
import { runParallelSdkReviews } from '@ai-sdlc/orchestrator';

const result = await runParallelSdkReviews({
  diff, prTitle, prNumber, reviewPolicy, workDir,
});
// result.verdicts — 3 parallel reviews (testing, security, quality)
// result.allApproved — true if all reviewers approved
```

## Action Governance

Agents operate under declarative constraints defined in `agent-role.yaml`:

```yaml
spec:
  constraints:
    blockedActions:
      - 'gh pr merge*'       # Only humans merge
      - 'git push --force*'  # No force push
      - 'gh pr close*'       # Only humans close PRs
      - 'git branch -D*'     # No branch deletion
      - 'git reset --hard*'  # No destructive resets
    blockedPaths:
      - '.github/workflows/**'
      - '.ai-sdlc/**'
    requireTests: true
    maxFilesPerChange: 15
```

Enforcement happens at three layers:
1. **Orchestrator** — `checkAction()` validates commands before execution with audit logging
2. **Claude Code hooks** — PreToolUse hook reads `blockedActions` from config and blocks matching Bash commands in real-time
3. **Branch protection** — Required status checks (CI, review, coverage) with `enforce_admins: true`

## Workflow Pattern Detection

The orchestrator observes how developers use AI agents and automatically detects repetitive workflows:

1. **Telemetry** — A PostToolUse hook captures every tool call to JSONL with canonicalized actions
2. **Detection** — N-gram mining (n=3 to 8) finds sequences repeated across 3+ sessions
3. **Classification** — Patterns are classified as command sequences, copy-paste cycles, or periodic tasks
4. **Proposals** — Each pattern generates a draft automation matching project conventions:

| Pattern Type | Output Artifact |
|---|---|
| Command sequence (3+ step chain) | `.claude/commands/<name>.md` |
| Copy-paste cycle (read/write across files) | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Periodic task (regular intervals) | `.github/workflows/<name>.yml` |

**Key principle:** The LLM observes and proposes, but the output is deterministic code — no AI in the runtime loop.

## Specification

The orchestrator is built on a formal specification with five declarative resource types:
