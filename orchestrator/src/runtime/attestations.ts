/**
 * Cryptographic review attestations (AISDLC-74).
 *
 * `/ai-sdlc execute` runs three reviewer subagents (code/test/security) locally
 * before pushing. CI then re-ran the same reviewers via `Post Review Results` —
 * burning tokens on duplicate work.
 *
 * This module provides the primitives `/ai-sdlc execute` and the
 * `verify-attestation.yml` workflow share to skip CI review when a valid local
 * attestation exists. The shape is a DSSE envelope (in-toto / SLSA pattern)
 * carrying a versioned predicate that commits to the commit SHA, diff hash,
 * policy hash, and reviewer agent file hashes — so CI can reject envelopes
 * after force-push, after a policy edit, or after a reviewer agent change.
 *
 * ## Threat model (in-scope)
 *
 *  - Lazy contributor faking attestation         → signature mismatch
 *  - Copy-pasted attestation from another PR     → subject digest mismatch
 *  - Replay after diff changed (force-push)      → diffHash mismatch
 *  - Attestation issued before a policy edit     → policyHash mismatch
 *  - Stale reviewer-agent attestation            → agentFileHash mismatch
 *  - Schema drift / forward-compat smuggling     → schemaVersion enforcement
 *
 * Out of scope: compromised dev machine, compromised CI runner, collusion.
 *
 * ## Why ed25519 + Node's built-in crypto (no Sigstore)
 *
 * The keys are project-controlled, committed in `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml`,
 * and small (32-byte). Sigstore would add Fulcio + Rekor + transparency log
 * infrastructure for no benefit at this scale. ed25519 is what `ssh-keygen
 * -t ed25519` and `git commit -S` already use; Node's `crypto.sign(null, ...)`
 * supports it natively.

   *    AISDLC-93 / PR #102 sibling-overlap case (the rebased file's HEAD
   *    blob contained the sibling's contributions, so the head blob SHA
   *    changed even though OUR contribution was unchanged).
   *  - `contentHashV3` commits to the (base, head) blob-pair TRANSITION

   *
   * Required for v3 envelopes. The dual-hash (v1 → AISDLC-94) and

 *
 * Path entries containing `\t` or `\n` are rejected to keep the canonical
 * encoding injective (mirrors the rejection in `computeContentHash`). Such
 * paths are exceedingly rare in practice — git's default config disallows

/**
 * Compute the per-file-delta `contentHashV3` (AISDLC-101) over a set of
 * `{path, baseBlobSha, headBlobSha}` triples. The canonical encoding is
 * one line per entry, sorted ascending by path, with
 * `<path>\t<fileDeltaHash>\n` per line, where
 * `fileDeltaHash = sha256(baseBlobSha + ' -> ' + headBlobSha)`. The
 * outer `contentHashV3` is the sha256 of the concatenated lines.
 *
 * Why per-file delta hashing — and what it adds vs. AISDLC-94's `contentHash`:
 *   - `contentHash` (AISDLC-94) hashes the post-apply blob SHA per file.
 *     If a sibling PR landed between OUR sign + OUR merge AND modified
 *     the SAME file, the rebased file's HEAD blob SHA contains both the
 *     sibling contribution AND ours → contentHash diverges (false reject).
 *   - `contentHashV3` (AISDLC-101) hashes the (base, head) blob-pair
 *     transition per file. Provides a stricter "we moved file F from blob
 *     A to blob B" binding than just "we ended up at blob B". Any genuine
 *     content change still flips the head blob SHA → fileDeltaHash flips
 *     → contentHashV3 flips → reject (threat model preserved).
 *
 * This is the SECOND line of defense in the 3-layer rebase-tolerance
 * plan (AISDLC-94 = Phase 1 verifier-side dual-hash, AISDLC-102 = Phase 1.5
 * producer-side pre-sign rebase, AISDLC-101 = Phase 2 per-file delta).
 * The verifier OR's all three legs during the triple-hash window.
 *
 * Path-delimiter rejection (\t / \n) mirrors `computeContentHash` so the
 * canonical encoding stays injective regardless of caller input.
 *
 * Pure function. Idempotent against double-enumeration via dedup-by-path
 * (last-write-wins per path), same as `computeContentHash`.
