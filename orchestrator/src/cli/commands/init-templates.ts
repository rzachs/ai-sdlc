/**
 * Embedded template strings scaffolded by `ai-sdlc init` (AISDLC-143).
 *
 * Why these live in code instead of being read from disk at runtime:
 *  - The orchestrator ships as an npm package; users `npm i -g
 *    @ai-sdlc/orchestrator` and run `ai-sdlc init` in a brand new repo.
 *    The `dist/` payload would not include arbitrary `*.yml` source
 *    fixtures unless we listed each one in `package.json#files` AND
 *    plumbed a `__dirname`-based loader through esm import-meta.url.
 *  - Embedded strings work identically when invoked via `node ./dist/...`
 *    from a checkout, via `npx @ai-sdlc/orchestrator init`, or via a
 *    pre-bundled binary, with no runtime filesystem dependency.
 *
 * Drift policy: when the canonical workflow at
 * `.github/workflows/ai-sdlc-gate.yml` (or the audit-only
 * `verify-attestation.yml`) is updated for adopters, mirror the change
 * here. The init-workspace test suite includes a smoke check that the
 * embedded copy at least parses as a YAML mapping; AISDLC-140 sub-3's
 * cutover memo will add a hard byte-equality assertion against the live
 * file once the framework's own copy stabilizes.
 *
 * Q-decisions baked into the templates:
 *  - Q1 (prescriptive default): the gate workflow is scaffolded
 *    unconditionally — every adopter gets `ai-sdlc/pr-ready` on day one.
 *  - Q3 (attestation = audit-only): verify-attestation template is the
 *    audit-only variant; signing infrastructure is opt-in via
 *    `--with-attestation`.
 *  - Q4(b) (interactive default with --yes escape hatch): see
 *    `init-features.ts` for the wizard wiring; this module just supplies
 *    the byte content.

 *   3. `ai-sdlc-review.yml` — CI-side reviewer fan-out + `Post Review Results` status.
 *   4. `auto-enable-auto-merge.yml` — arms auto-merge on every same-repo PR.
 *
 * Idempotent: files already present are skipped by default; `--force` overwrites.
 *
 * Source of truth: `.github/workflows/` in the ai-sdlc framework repo.
 * Mirror changes here when the adopter-facing API evolves.
