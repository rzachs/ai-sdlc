# AI-SDLC Review Policy

This document provides calibration context for the automated review agents.
**You MUST read and apply this policy before analyzing the PR.** False positives
waste developer time and block the pipeline. Only flag issues you are confident
are real problems with a plausible attack vector or correctness impact.

## Golden Rule

**When in doubt, approve with a suggestion — do not request changes.**

Only use `REQUEST_CHANGES` severity (`critical` or `major`) when you can
describe a specific, realistic scenario where the code causes harm. If you
cannot construct a concrete exploit or failure case, downgrade to `minor` or
`suggestion`.

## CI Boundary — Deterministic Checks You Must Defer To

The following CI checks run automatically on every PR. They are deterministic and authoritative. **Do NOT duplicate their findings.** If CI catches it, it is not your job.

| CI Check | What It Covers | Your Scope? |
|---|---|---|
| ESLint (`pnpm lint`) | Lint violations, unused imports, naming | No |
| Prettier (`pnpm format:check`) | Formatting, whitespace, semicolons | No |
| TypeScript (`pnpm build`) | Type errors, missing types, generics | No |
| Vitest (`pnpm test`) | Test failures, broken assertions | No |
| Codecov (`codecov/patch`) | Line coverage on changed code (80% patch) | No |
| Schema validation | YAML/JSON schema conformance | No |
| Python ruff + mypy | Python lint + types (sdk-python only) | No |
| Go tests | Go unit tests (sdk-go only) | No |

**What IS your scope** (things CI cannot catch):
- Logic errors that compile and pass existing tests but produce wrong behavior
- Security vulnerabilities with realistic attack vectors
- Missing error handling for untested edge cases
- Design issues: wrong abstraction, pattern violations, unnecessary complexity
- Acceptance criteria not addressed by the implementation
- Concurrency hazards, performance anti-patterns

## Threat Model

### Trusted Input Sources (do NOT flag for injection)
- `.ai-sdlc/*.yaml` pipeline configuration files — committed by maintainers, reviewed in PRs
- `orchestrator/src/defaults.ts` constants — hardcoded values, not user-controlled
- Notification templates from `pipeline.yaml` `spec.notifications.templates` — same as above
- Agent role constraints from `agent-role.yaml` — same as above
- Review policy content from `.ai-sdlc/review-policy.md` — this file, committed by maintainers
- `resolveRepoRoot()` output — returns the git working directory, not user-controlled

### Untrusted Input Sources (DO flag for injection)
- Issue titles and bodies from GitHub (user-submitted)
- PR bodies and review comments (could contain adversarial content)
- Slack message content from external users
- CLI arguments from external callers
- Agent output (filesChanged, summary) — LLM-generated, could be manipulated

## Regex Patterns — When to Flag ReDoS

**DO NOT flag these as ReDoS — they are safe:**
- Bounded character classes: `[a-z0-9-]{0,30}` — linear time, no backtracking possible
- Fixed-length quantifiers: `\d{1,15}` — bounded, cannot backtrack
- Character classes without alternation: `[a-zA-Z0-9/_.-]+` — no ambiguity
- `regex.exec()` in a `while` loop with `/g` flag — `lastIndex` advances linearly, this is the standard JS pattern for finding all matches. It is NOT quadratic.
- Any pattern where the character class has no overlapping alternatives
- **Single `.*` wildcard patterns from trusted config** (e.g., `^gh pr merge.*$`) — a pattern with ONE `.*` cannot cause backtracking because there is only one way to match. The pattern `a.*b.*c.*` with MULTIPLE `.*` can theoretically backtrack, but our `blockedActions` patterns are simple globs like `gh pr merge*` that convert to a single `.*`. Do NOT flag these.
- **`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable** — this is set by Claude Code itself, not by users. It is a trusted source. Do NOT flag `execSync('git rev-parse')` as command injection when the fallback only runs if the env var is unset.

**DO flag these as ReDoS — they are dangerous:**
- Nested quantifiers with alternation: `(a+)+$`, `(a|aa)+`
- Unbounded repetition on overlapping groups: `(\w+\s*)*`
- Patterns where the engine can match the same character via multiple paths
- Multiple overlapping `.*` in a single pattern from untrusted input

**The definitive test:** Can the regex engine take exponentially different paths for the same input? If no, it is safe. A single `.*` has exactly one match path — it is always linear.

## Concurrency and Race Conditions

**DO NOT flag as race conditions:**
- Sequential `await` calls in the same async function — these execute in strict order, period
- In-memory variables within a single function invocation — no concurrent access is possible
- Cloudflare Worker module-level variables — Workers handle one request at a time per isolate
- Two lines of code in the same function body — there is no "window" for another workflow to interfere between sequential statements in a single execution context

**DO flag as race conditions:**
- Shared state across separate GitHub Actions workflow runs
- Multiple workflows writing to the same branch simultaneously
- State that depends on external API calls being atomic (they're not)

## HTML/Template Sanitization

**DO NOT flag as injection vulnerabilities:**
- Template content from `.ai-sdlc/*.yaml` config files (trusted source, reviewed in PRs)
- Markdown content posted to GitHub issue comments — GitHub sanitizes markdown rendering and strips dangerous HTML
- Simple `/<[^>]*>/g` tag stripping on trusted-source config values — this is defense-in-depth, not the primary security boundary

**DO flag as injection vulnerabilities:**
- User-submitted content interpolated into shell commands without escaping
- User-submitted content used in `eval()`, `new Function()`, or `innerHTML`
- Untrusted input used in SQL queries without parameterization

## Testing Standards

### Code Coverage — Defer to Codecov

**DO NOT report code coverage percentages or claim "zero coverage" on files.**
You do not have access to coverage data. The `codecov/patch` CI check validates
actual line coverage from test runs. Your job is to review code quality and
logic, not coverage metrics.

Specifically:
- Do NOT say "this file has zero test coverage" — you cannot know this
- Do NOT say "missing test coverage for function X" unless the function
  has genuinely no tests anywhere (check all test files, not just co-located ones)
- Tests for a module can live in a different test file (e.g., `classifiers.ts`
  tested via `detector.test.ts`)
- If codecov/patch passes, coverage is adequate — do not second-guess it

### What Requires Tests (logic review, not coverage metrics)
- All public functions should have at least one test exercising the happy path
- Error paths for security-critical functions
- Boundary conditions for algorithms (thresholds, limits)

### What Does NOT Require Test Coverage (DO NOT flag as critical/major)
- **GitHub Actions workflow YAML changes** — tested by running the workflow
- **Thin CLI wrappers** that parse args and call orchestrator functions — tested via the orchestrator tests
- `console.error` logging statements in catch blocks
- Re-exports in `index.ts` barrel files
- **Type-only files** (`types.ts`) — no runtime code to cover

### Test Replacement vs Test Removal
When a test is removed and replaced with a different test that covers the same code path differently, this is NOT a reduction in coverage. Do not flag test replacements as "removed test coverage" unless the replacement genuinely covers fewer paths.

## Severity Classification

Use these definitions strictly:

- **critical**: Logic error that causes data loss, security breach, or infinite loop in production. You must be able to describe the exact failure scenario.
- **major**: Bug that affects correctness in common code paths, or a security issue with a plausible real-world attack vector. "Theoretically possible" is not sufficient — describe the attack.
- **minor**: Code quality issue that doesn't affect correctness but would improve the code
- **suggestion**: Nice-to-have improvement with no correctness or security impact

**If you cannot describe a concrete failure scenario or attack vector, it is NOT critical or major.**

## Common False Positives — DO NOT FLAG

These patterns have been repeatedly flagged incorrectly. Do not flag them:

1. "ReDoS on bounded character class" — `[a-z0-9-]{0,30}` is safe
2. "Race condition between sequential await calls" — impossible in a single async function
3. "Template injection from config file" — config files are trusted
4. "Empty catch block" with explanatory comment — intentional for best-effort ops
5. "Missing unit test for workflow YAML change" — workflows are tested by running them
6. "Information disclosure in Slack messages" — private channel with trusted devs
7. "Path traversal in resolveRepoRoot()" — returns git working directory, not user-controlled
8. "Unsafe JSON.parse on controlled source" — our own API/CLI output format
9. "`exec()` with `/g` regex in while loop is quadratic" — it is linear, this is the standard JS pattern
10. "Removed test reduces coverage" — when test was replaced, not removed
11. "ReDoS on single `.*` wildcard from trusted config" — `^gh pr merge.*$` has ONE `.*`, cannot backtrack. Only multiple overlapping `.*` from untrusted input is dangerous.
12. "Command injection via CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR" — this env var is set by Claude Code itself, not user-controlled. The `execSync('git rev-parse')` fallback is a standard git pattern.
13. "Command injection in shell hook via PATTERN" — when PATTERN comes from `.ai-sdlc/agent-role.yaml` (trusted, committed by maintainers). Only flag if pattern comes from untrusted input.
14. "Missing tests for Claude Code hook scripts" — hook scripts (.js files in `ai-sdlc-plugin/hooks/`) are tested via Node built-in test runner (`.test.mjs` files), NOT Vitest. They run as child process integration tests. Do NOT flag missing Vitest tests for hook scripts.
15. "Missing code for future phase" — when a PR is explicitly scoped as "Phase 1 of N" or "partial implementation", do NOT flag missing code that is planned for a future PR. The PR description explains what's included and what's deferred.
16. "JSON.parse prototype pollution" — V8's `JSON.parse` does NOT support `__proto__` injection in a way that affects prototype chains. Parsed `__proto__` keys become plain string properties. This is a reduced risk, not zero risk — but only flag if the parsed object is merged into prototypes or used with Object.assign on untrusted input.
17. "Unsafe JSON.parse on JSONL file" — when the file is written by our own hook. The JSONL at `~/.claude/usage-data/tool-sequences.jsonl` is written by the PostToolUse hook, not external users. This is reduced risk, not zero risk — validate if the data is used in security-sensitive contexts.
18. "Zero test coverage for file X" — you cannot measure coverage. Defer to codecov/patch CI check. Tests may exist in a different test file. Do NOT flag coverage claims as critical.
19. "SDK runner mocks out real SDK" — the `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` is an optional peer dependency not installed in the test environment. The SDK streaming loops are marked with `/* v8 ignore */` because they genuinely cannot execute without the real package. Static helper functions ARE tested. Do NOT flag mocked SDK imports as major — it is a known, intentional limitation.
20. "Agent definition .md files not tested" — agent definitions are tested via frontmatter parsing tests that verify tool restrictions (allowedTools/disallowedTools). The agent `.md` content is declarative configuration, not executable code.
21. "parseSimpleYaml only supports 2-level nesting" — this is by design. The enterprise config format is intentionally flat. If deeper nesting is needed, replace with a real YAML parser (js-yaml).
