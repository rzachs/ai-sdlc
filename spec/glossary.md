## Terms

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol) {#a2a}

A protocol for inter-agent communication, task delegation, and capability discovery, originally developed by Google and governed under the Linux Foundation's AAIF. AI-SDLC agents publish A2A-compatible [Agent Cards](#agent-card) for discovery. See [agents.md](agents.md#agent-discovery).

### Adapter {#adapter}

A standalone module implementing one or more [interface contracts](#interface-contract) for a specific tool. For example, a Linear adapter implements the [IssueTracker](#interface-contract) interface. Adapters are registered via `metadata.yaml` and discovered from a registry, local directory, or git reference. See [adapters.md](adapters.md).

### AnalyticsProvider {#analytics-provider}

An [adapter](#adapter) interface for product analytics platforms (e.g., PostHog, Amplitude). Provides feature usage, active user counts, retention rates, and NPS scores.

### Resource {#resource}

A declarative object with five top-level fields: `apiVersion`, `kind`, [metadata](#metadata), `spec`, and `status`. All AI-SDLC configuration is expressed as resources. See [spec.md](spec.md#2-resource-model).

### Role-Goal-Backstory {#role-goal-backstory}

The pattern used by [AgentRole](#agent-role) resources to define an agent's identity. `role` is the agent's title, `goal` is what it aims to achieve, and `backstory` provides context for the agent's persona. Derived from the CrewAI framework. See [agents.md](agents.md#agent-role-schema).

### Routing Strategy {#routing-strategy}

The method by which tasks are assigned to agents based on [complexity score](#complexity-score). Four strategies are defined: `fully-autonomous`, `ai-with-review`, `ai-assisted`, and `human-led`. See [autonomy.md](autonomy.md#complexity-based-task-routing).

An [adapter](#adapter) interface for customer support ticket systems (e.g., Zendesk, Intercom). Provides ticket listings, feature request counts, and real-time ticket event streams. Used by the [Priority Policy](#priority-policy) to feed Demand Pressure signals into the Product Priority Algorithm. See [adapters.md](adapters.md#36-supportchannel).

### Spec/Status Split {#spec-status-split}

The separation of user intent (`spec`) from system-observed reality (`status`) in every [resource](#resource). `spec` represents desired state; `status` represents what the system observes. Controllers continuously reconcile the gap. See [spec.md](spec.md#4-the-specstatus-split).

### Transaction Limit {#transaction-limit}

A guardrail field in [AutonomyPolicy](#autonomy-policy) that specifies maximum cost per time period. See autonomy-policy.schema.json.
