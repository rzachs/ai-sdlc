## 1. Summary

A **Variant** is a soul-scoped sub-theme within a Soul DID (RFC-0009 §2): a named configuration that carries distinct visual identity specializations and audience targeting while inheriting the parent Soul DID's foundational triad (E × P × D) and compliance regime.

This RFC defines the **In-Soul Variant Pattern** — how variants are declared on a Soul DID, how they inherit from their parent, how the admission composite (RFC-0008 / RFC-0005) scores work items that target a specific variant rather than the full soul, and where the boundary lies between "this is a variant" and "this is a separate soul."

The pattern is **configuration-based, not flow-based**. Flow-based sub-divisions (sequences of states + transitions) are RFC-0018's concern; this RFC handles the static configuration overlay.

**Practitioner validation source:** InternalAdopter's four-product suite (ProductA, ProductB, ProductC, ProductD). Each product is a distinct soul on shared substrate. Within each product, audience-specific variants emerge — e.g., ProductA has variants for small-utility-municipality vs. large-municipality vs. county-level deployments — each with distinct visual specializations and audience profiles, but all sharing the soul's WCAG 2.1 AA compliance floor and shared design system tokens.

## 2. Motivation

Today, the Soul DID model (RFC-0009) gives a single design intent surface per product face. This is correct for cases where a product has one cohesive identity. But practitioners report:

- A product targets multiple audience segments with distinct visual specializations (e.g., small-utility vs. enterprise) that share the same compliance regime + design system foundation
- Forcing each audience-segment to be its own Soul DID creates platform-level fragmentation: the substrate doesn't actually differ; only the visual + audience specialization does
- Forcing them to share one Soul DID collapses the per-segment design intent into platform-aggregate scoring (the same observed failure mode as multi-product platforms in RFC-0009 §3, applied one scope down)

Specifically observed: **a Soul DID's `design.imperatives` field feeds Sα₂ Vibe Coherence scoring at soul scope. When a soul has multiple audience-specific variants, soul-aggregate Sα₂ scoring produces the same misallocation pattern RFC-0009 documented at the platform↔soul boundary** — work that's variant-bounded (e.g., a small-utility-only feature) gets scored against the soul-aggregate design intent, which underweights the variant's specific design imperatives.

The framework needs an in-soul partition for this case that:

1. Inherits the soul's compliance + substrate (no escape hatch)
2. Allows a bounded specialization of design intent
3. Composes cleanly with admission scoring (variant-targeted work scores against variant intent, not soul-aggregate)

## 3. Goals

1. **First-class variant declaration on Soul DID** — `soul.spec.variants[]` with id, audience, design overrides
2. **Bounded inheritance** — variants inherit substrate + compliance from parent Soul; cannot escape either
3. **Admission scoring composes** — `targetedVariants` field on work items routes scoring through variant-level design intent (analogous to RFC-0009's `targetedSouls`)
4. **Boundary clarity** — explicit guidance for when to use a variant vs. spawn a separate Soul DID
5. **Backward compatibility** — Soul DIDs without variants behave identically to today
6. **Practitioner validation** — InternalAdopter's four-product suite proves out the pattern before normative status

## 4. Non-Goals

1. **Flow-based sub-divisions** — that's RFC-0018 (Journey). Variant is static configuration; Journey is temporal sequence.
2. **Cross-soul variants** — a variant lives within a single Soul DID. Cross-soul work uses RFC-0009's `targetedSouls`.
3. **Independent compliance regimes per variant** — variants inherit the soul's compliance floor with no escape hatch. If two configurations require different compliance regimes, they're separate Souls.
4. **Variant marketplaces** — third-party / customer-defined variants are explicitly out of scope; v1 limits variant declaration to the Soul DID author (Design Authority).
5. **Substrate divergence** — variants share the soul's `substrateInvariants` exactly. Substrate-level differences require a separate Soul.

## 5. Proposal

### 5.1 Variant declaration on Soul DID

Add `variants[]` to Soul DID `spec`:

```yaml
apiVersion: ai-sdlc.io/v1alpha1
kind: SoulDID
metadata:
  name: spry-engage
spec:
  # ... existing Soul DID fields ...
  variants:
    - id: small-utility
      targetAudience:
        segments: [municipal-small, water-district-small]
        sizeRange: { minStaff: 1, maxStaff: 50 }
      designOverrides:
        voiceRegister: "approachable-municipal"
        colorPaletteOverlay: "small-utility-warm"
        densityProfile: "comfortable"
      complianceFloor: inherit  # MUST inherit; explicit for clarity
      designImperatives:
        - "low-tech-fluency-tolerance"
        - "single-task-focus-per-screen"
    - id: enterprise
      targetAudience:
        segments: [municipal-large, regional-utility]
        sizeRange: { minStaff: 51, maxStaff: 5000 }
      designOverrides:
        voiceRegister: "professional-administrative"
        colorPaletteOverlay: "enterprise-cool"
        densityProfile: "compact"
      complianceFloor: inherit
      designImperatives:
        - "bulk-operation-efficiency"
        - "multi-tab-workflow-tolerance"
```

### 5.2 Variant fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string (kebab-case, unique within soul) | yes | Variant identifier |
| `targetAudience` | object | yes | Audience characteristics; structure mirrors Soul DID `targetAudience` schema (Sα₁ input) |
| `designOverrides` | object | no | Subset of design fields the variant specializes (voice, color overlay, density). MUST be a subset of fields the parent Soul declares as variant-overridable. |
| `complianceFloor` | enum (`inherit`) | yes | MUST be `inherit`. Variants cannot diverge from soul compliance. The field is required-and-fixed for clarity at the YAML surface — schema validation rejects any other value. |
| `designImperatives` | string[] | no | Variant-scoped Sα₂ inputs. Layered on top of soul-level `designImperatives`; variant imperatives take precedence in conflict (most-specific-wins). |
| `cardinality` (RESERVED) | enum (`primary`, `secondary`, `experimental`) | no | Future-use lifecycle hint. v1 ignores; documents the `experimental` exit ramp for OQ-3. |

### 5.3 Bounded inheritance

A Variant inherits from its parent Soul DID:

| Inherited (variant cannot override) | Specializable (variant overrides allowed) |
|---|---|
| `complianceRegimes` (per-soul) | `voiceRegister` (variant-scoped) |
| `substrateInvariants` | `colorPaletteOverlay` (additive layer over soul palette) |
| `tenantQuotaShare` (RFC-0010) | `densityProfile` |
| `engineering.performanceBudgets` | `designImperatives` (additive, most-specific-wins) |
| `engineering.observabilityRequirements` | `targetAudience` (variant-specific segments) |

If a variant attempts to override an inherited field, schema validation MUST emit `VariantInheritanceViolation` (Engineering vertex error per RFC-0008 §C5).

### 5.4 Admission scoring composition

Work items target a variant via `targetedVariants` (parallel to RFC-0009 `targetedSouls`):

```yaml
apiVersion: ai-sdlc.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkItem
metadata:
  name: small-utility-onboarding-improvement
spec:
  targetedSouls: [spry-engage]
  targetedVariants: [spry-engage/small-utility]   # Soul-id/Variant-id
```

Scoring composes per-variant:

- **Sα₁ Audience Resonance** — variant's `targetAudience` overrides soul's
- **Sα₂ Vibe Coherence** — variant's `designImperatives` UNION soul's; conflict resolution: variant wins (most-specific)
- **Cκ Capability Coverage** — soul-level (variants don't override capability)
- **Eρ_n** — soul-level (variants inherit compliance/substrate; no override)
- **Dπ_n** — soul-level (Demand Pressure / Market Force / Entropy Tax are platform-aggregate channels)

Cross-variant scoring rule (work touches multiple variants of same soul) — same `min` aggregation as RFC-0009 §7.2 for cross-soul, applied at the variant scope. Per RFC-0009 OQ-2: `min` is the default; opt-in alternatives (`max`, `weighted`) require explicit declaration.

### 5.5 Boundary: variant vs. separate Soul

**Use a Variant when:**
- Same compliance regime (WCAG level, regulatory posture, retention rules)
- Same substrate (event bus, schema, tenant model)
- Different audience + visual specialization within the same product face

**Use a separate Soul when:**
- Different compliance regime (e.g., HIPAA vs. SOC2, different WCAG level)
- Different substrate (different event bus, different schema, different tenant model)
- Different "product face" (operator + adopter both perceive these as distinct products)

The Design Authority owns the boundary call. When uncertain, default to **separate Soul** — variants are an optimization for the homogeneous-substrate case; separate Souls are the safe default that preserves flexibility.

## 6. Design Details

### 6.1 Schema additions

Add to the Soul DID schema (file path: RFC-0009 implementation phase concern):

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "variants": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["id", "targetAudience", "complianceFloor"],
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "properties": {
          "id": {
            "type": "string",
            "pattern": "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$",
            "description": "Kebab-case variant identifier; unique within the soul."
          },
          "targetAudience": { "$ref": "#/$defs/AudienceProfile" },
          "designOverrides": {
            "type": "object",
            "additionalProperties": false,
            "properties": {
              "voiceRegister": { "type": "string" },
              "colorPaletteOverlay": { "type": "string" },
              "densityProfile": { "type": "string", "enum": ["compact", "comfortable", "spacious"] }
            }
          },
          "complianceFloor": {
            "type": "string",
            "const": "inherit",
            "description": "MUST be 'inherit'. Variants cannot diverge from soul compliance."
          },
          "designImperatives": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "cardinality": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["primary", "secondary", "experimental"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add to the Work Item schema:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "targetedVariants": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string",
        "pattern": "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*\\/[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$",
        "description": "Soul-id/variant-id format."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 6.2 Behavioral changes

- **Reconciliation** — when a variant is added/removed/modified, the `Eτ_tessellation_drift` detector (RFC-0009 §13) MUST scan substrate code for variant-specific identifiers (parallel to per-soul scan). Substrate code referring to specific variant IDs is a drift signal.
- **Admission scoring** — when `targetedVariants` is non-empty, the admission scorer routes Sα₁ + Sα₂ inputs through variant-level fields. When empty, scoring proceeds at soul scope (unchanged from RFC-0009 baseline).
- **Cross-soul work** — when a work item targets variants in MULTIPLE souls, the cross-soul aggregation rule (RFC-0009 §7.2) applies at the soul level FIRST, then the cross-variant rule applies within each soul.

### 6.3 Migration path

Soul DIDs without `variants[]` declared are unchanged. Adding variants is purely additive. Removing a variant requires:

1. Sweep `targetedVariants` across all open work items; reject removal if any work item references the variant
2. Provide deprecation window (default 30 days) before hard-removal
3. Emit `VariantRemoved` event per RFC-0008 event taxonomy

## 7. Backward Compatibility

**Not a breaking change.** Soul DIDs that don't declare `variants[]` continue to behave identically. Work items that don't declare `targetedVariants` are scored at soul scope as before.

The only soft regression: if a Soul DID's Sα₂ scoring previously relied on operator-implicit knowledge of audience-specific design intent, surfacing variants makes that intent explicit AND scorable. Some operators may discover their existing `designImperatives` are over-aggregated; the migration is to factor them into variant-specific lists.

## 8. Alternatives Considered

### 8.1 Subclasses (variant inherits Soul via `extends:`)

OO-style inheritance with method-override semantics. **Rejected** — too sharp an edge; operators end up reasoning about what's overridable. The bounded-inheritance table (§5.3) is more constrained and less surprising.

### 8.2 Composition (variant composes a Soul + an overlay resource)

Variants as separate `kind: SoulVariant` resources composed at admission time. **Rejected** — adds a resource kind for a sub-concern that's tightly bound to a parent. Composition makes sense across loosely-coupled concerns; variant ↔ soul is a tight binding.

### 8.3 Tags / labels (variant as a label dimension on work items)

Skip the schema change; route through label-based filtering. **Rejected** — doesn't compose with admission scoring; loses the inheritance contract; doesn't surface in the Tessellated Design Intent Document hierarchy.

### 8.4 Just spawn a separate Soul per variant

The "use the existing Soul DID model" answer. **Rejected for the homogeneous-substrate case** (per §5.5) — creates platform-level fragmentation when the substrate genuinely doesn't differ. **Recommended for the heterogeneous-substrate case** — RFC keeps the boundary explicit.

## 9. Implementation Plan

- [ ] Soul DID schema addition (`variants[]`)
- [ ] Work Item schema addition (`targetedVariants`)
- [ ] Admission scorer composition (Sα₁ + Sα₂ variant routing)
- [ ] Variant inheritance validator (`VariantInheritanceViolation` event)
- [ ] `Eτ_tessellation_drift` detector extension for variant-scoped scans
- [ ] InternalAdopter four-product suite as reference implementation (one variant per product, minimum)
- [ ] Glossary additions (`Variant`, `targetedVariants`, `complianceFloor: inherit`)
- [ ] Conformance test suite — variant declaration round-trip; admission-scoring composition; inheritance enforcement
- [ ] Author/update each user-facing doc surface declared in `requiresDocs` (currently `[]` — pending tutorial/runbook decision)

## 10. Open Questions

These need design + operator walkthrough before Lifecycle: Draft → Ready for Review.

**OQ-1 — Maximum variants per Soul:** Should the schema cap variant count (e.g., max 5) to discourage over-fragmentation, or trust operators? Recommendation: soft warning at 5+, hard limit at 20 (sanity check, not design constraint).

**OQ-2 — Nested variants:** Can a variant declare its own sub-variants? Recommendation: NO for v1 — adds complexity for a use case (variant-of-variant) we have no practitioner evidence for. Revisit if InternalAdopter or another adopter surfaces a real need.

**OQ-3 — Variant lifecycle (deprecation, removal):** §6.3 sketches the removal flow. What's the right deprecation-window default — 30 days, 90 days, or operator-configured per Soul? Recommendation: configurable per Soul with 30-day default.

**OQ-4 — Cross-variant scoring rule precedence:** RFC-0009 §7.2 sets `min` as cross-soul default. Same default for cross-variant within a soul, OR should variants default to `max` (since they're more loosely coupled than souls within a tessellation)? Recommendation: same `min` default for consistency.

**OQ-5 — designOverrides extensibility:** §6.1 lists `voiceRegister`, `colorPaletteOverlay`, `densityProfile`. Should this be open-ended (any field name) or closed-enum? Recommendation: closed-enum for v1 to force design-authority discipline; expand as new override needs surface.

**OQ-6 — Variant ID URI representation in DID:** RFC-0009 uses `did:platform-x:soul:engage`. What's the variant URI? Options: (a) `did:platform-x:soul:engage/variant:small-utility`, (b) `did:platform-x:soul:engage:small-utility` (slug-concat), (c) `did:platform-x:variant:engage/small-utility`. Recommendation: (a) — preserves explicit hierarchy.

**OQ-7 — Engineering authority on variant declarations:** RFC-0009 makes Design Authority the owner of `design.*` fields with Engineering as reviewer. Same model for variant declarations? Or does Engineering own `targetAudience` (since audience determines load characteristics)? Recommendation: Design owns variant declaration; Engineering reviews + may block on substrate-cost grounds.

**OQ-8 — `cardinality` field activation:** §5.2 reserves `cardinality: primary | secondary | experimental` for v2. What's the v1 → v2 trigger to activate this — practitioner demand, or a specific lifecycle event? Recommendation: defer activation to a follow-on RFC when at least 2 adopters request lifecycle distinctions.

## 11. Practitioner Validation Plan

InternalAdopter's four-product suite drives the validation pass:

| Soul | Variants (proposed) | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| ProductA | small-utility, enterprise, county-regional | Audience-segment specialization; voice register variation |
| ProductB | field-tech-on-truck, field-tech-handheld, supervisor-tablet | Density profile + form-factor specialization |
| ProductC | billing-clerk, customer-portal, csr-dashboard | Role-based audience + workflow-density specialization |
| ProductD | annual-test, repair-event, regulatory-audit-mode | Temporal-context-bound design intent (validates the §11 carries through to RFC-0018 Journey too) |

Validation criteria (Mo's edits welcome):
1. Each variant's design intent is articulable in ≤ 5 `designImperatives` strings
2. No variant requires a field NOT in the §6.1 schema (closed-enum holds)
3. Admission scoring on a real work item (e.g., "small-utility onboarding improvement") produces a different + better-justified score than soul-aggregate scoring
4. Engineering vertex confirms substrate is genuinely shared across all variants of each soul (no hidden divergence)
