# AI-SDLC RFC Process

This document describes the RFC (Request for Comments) process for proposing changes to the AI-SDLC Framework specification. The process is modeled on Kubernetes KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals) and OpenTelemetry OTEPs.

## What Requires an RFC

An RFC is required for:

- Adding, removing, or modifying a core resource type
- Adding or removing required fields from any resource schema
- Changing the semantics of existing normative requirements
- Adding a new interface contract to the adapter layer
- Adding or modifying enforcement levels
- Changing the autonomy level framework
- Adding a new conformance level
- Any change that could break backward compatibility

An RFC is **not** required for:

- Editorial fixes (typos, formatting, clarifications that do not change meaning)
- Adding optional fields to existing resource schemas
- Adding new enum values to existing fields
- Adding informative content to non-normative documents
- Updating examples or glossary entries

## Addendums — DEPRECATED (create a new RFC instead)

**Do not add new Addendums (Addendum A, Addendum B, etc.) to existing RFCs.** Create a new RFC.

### Why

Historically, several RFCs (RFC-0006, RFC-0007, RFC-0008, RFC-0009) used an "Addendum A / Addendum B / ..." pattern to extend a signed-off RFC with significant additional content. Operator review of this pattern (2026-05-04) found:

- **Review structure suffers** — an Addendum re-opens a signed-off RFC for review of just the new section, but the diff/PR surface conflates "the new content" with "minor edits to the original." Reviewers can't easily separate "I'm endorsing the addition" from "I'm re-endorsing the whole thing."
- **Sign-off semantics get muddy** — does signing the Addendum re-sign the whole RFC? Different RFCs answered this differently; there's no consistent contract.
- **Cross-references break** — `RFC-0008 §A.5` is harder to cite + maintain than `RFC-0029` (a hypothetical separate RFC). Internal links in tooling have to handle both `#section-id` and `#addendum-a-section-id` patterns.
- **RFCs become unbounded** — an Addendum-bearing RFC has no natural "this is done" point; it accretes addendums indefinitely. Separate RFCs are bounded artifacts that can ship + sign-off independently.
- **Lifecycle drift** — the parent RFC's `lifecycle: Signed Off` is technically correct for the original content but misleading for the Addendum (which may still be Draft). Separate RFCs maintain accurate lifecycle per artifact.

### What to do instead

When you'd be tempted to add an Addendum:

1. **Reserve a new RFC number** in the [Registry](#registry) with `Status: Reserved` + a one-line description of what the new content covers
2. **Draft the new RFC** with `requires: [<parent-rfc-id>]` in its frontmatter — the dependency is explicit
3. **Reference the parent** in §1 Summary: "This RFC extends RFC-NNNN with..."
4. **Open a separate PR** for the new RFC — independent review, independent sign-off, independent lifecycle
5. **The parent stays signed-off** — no re-opening required

### Historical Addendums (preserved as-is)

The Addendums in RFC-0006 (Addendum A + B), RFC-0007 (cross-references RFC-0006 Addendum A), RFC-0008 (Addendum A + B), and RFC-0009 (RFC-0008 Addendum A reference) are **kept** — they are signed-off normative content. The deprecation applies to NEW addendum creation only.

If a historical Addendum needs revision, prefer to carve it out to its own RFC at that revision pass (operator decision; not required).

## RFC Lifecycle (AISDLC-118)

The `lifecycle` frontmatter field captures the per-owner sign-off + implementation arc:

```
Draft → Ready for Review → Signed Off → Implemented
                                              │
                                              └─→ Superseded (terminal)
```

| Lifecycle | Meaning | Sign-off state |
|---|---|---|
| **Draft** | Initial brainstorm; structure may shift | Sign-off boxes empty |
| **Ready for Review** | Structure stable; ready for owner sign-off | At least one owner signed; awaiting others |
| **Signed Off** | All owners signed; design locked | All owner boxes checked |
| **Implemented** | Corresponding milestone reached Done | n/a (post-sign-off state) |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by newer RFC | Header notes the successor |

**Drafts MUST land on main early.** As soon as the author considers the RFC shareable (typically after the first internal pass), it should be merged to main with `lifecycle: Draft`. Stakeholders can then reference it at its canonical `spec/rfcs/RFC-NNNN-*.md` URL while iteration continues through normal PR review. **Sign-off no longer gates visibility** — these are orthogonal questions. Hiding drafts until sign-off destroys the feedback loop the RFC process is supposed to create.

The `lifecycle` field is separate from the per-owner sign-off checklist that lives in the RFC body (`## Sign-Off`). The checklist is the source of truth for which individual owners have signed; `lifecycle` is the aggregate state used by the index table and tooling.

### Legacy `status` field

The original `status` enum (Draft / Under Review / Approved / Implemented / Final / Rejected / Withdrawn) is retained for back-compat with `scripts/check-rfc-docs.mjs`, which uses it to decide when to enforce the `requiresDocs` gate. New RFCs SHOULD set both fields. Mapping guide:

| `lifecycle` | Recommended `status` |
|---|---|
| `Draft` | `Draft` |
| `Ready for Review` | `Draft` (use legacy `Under Review` only if you want the WG-review semantics) |
| `Signed Off` | `Approved` (or `Final` for sign-off-gated RFCs whose reference impl is still in flight) |
| `Implemented` | `Implemented` (or `Final` retained from the pre-AISDLC-118 convention) |
| `Superseded` | `Withdrawn` (and link the successor in the body) |

## Legacy RFC Lifecycle (pre-AISDLC-118)

The flow below describes the original Kubernetes-KEP-style process. AISDLC-118 reframes the visibility question (drafts on main early) but the per-stage activity descriptions still apply.

```
Draft → Discussion → WG Review → PoC → Approval → Spec Update
```

### 1. Draft

The author creates a new RFC by copying `RFC-0001-template.md` to `RFC-NNNN-title.md` (where NNNN is the next available number) and fills in all sections. The author submits the RFC as a pull request.

**Status:** `Draft`

### 2. Discussion

Community members review and discuss the RFC via PR comments. The author addresses feedback and updates the RFC. Discussion should run for at least 7 days.

**Status:** `Under Review`

### 3. Working Group Review

The relevant SIG (Special Interest Group) reviews the RFC for design soundness:

- **sig-spec** — Changes to core resource types, resource model, or reconciliation semantics
- **sig-adapters** — Changes to adapter interfaces, registration, or discovery
- **sig-security** — Changes to autonomy levels, policy enforcement, or security model

The SIG provides a recommendation (approve, request changes, or reject).

**Status:** `Under Review`

### 4. Proof of Concept

For substantive changes, the author demonstrates feasibility with a proof-of-concept implementation. The PoC may be a PR to the reference implementation repository showing the proposed change works as described.

**Status:** `Under Review`

### 5. Approval

The RFC requires:

- Two maintainer approvals
- A 7-day final comment period after the last substantive change
- SIG recommendation of approval

**Status:** `Approved`

### 6. Spec Update

After approval, the spec is updated to incorporate the RFC. The RFC status is updated to reflect the outcome.

**Status:** `Implemented`

## RFC Status Values

| Status         | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Draft`        | RFC is being written by the author                                                                                                                                            |
| `Under Review` | RFC is open for community discussion and SIG review                                                                                                                           |
| `Approved`     | RFC has been approved; spec update pending                                                                                                                                    |
| `Implemented`  | RFC has been merged into the specification                                                                                                                                    |
| `Final`        | Terminal pre-implementation status for sign-off-gated RFCs (RFC-0006, RFC-0008): the spec is locked but reference implementation work continues. Promotes to `Implemented` when the normative spec documents land. |
| `Rejected`     | RFC was reviewed and rejected                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Withdrawn`    | RFC was withdrawn by the author                                                                                                                                               |

## YAML Frontmatter Convention

Every RFC under `spec/rfcs/` MUST begin with a YAML frontmatter block (delimited by `---` on its own line, like Jekyll/Hugo posts). The frontmatter is the source of truth for tooling — CI workflows, dashboards, and the index table below all read it. The visible bold-status block in the RFC body (`**Status:** Draft`, etc.) is preserved for human readability but is informational only.

The schema lives at [`spec/schemas/rfc.schema.json`](../schemas/rfc.schema.json) and is the authoritative definition of allowed field names and values.

### Required fields

| Field          | Type            | Notes                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | string          | Canonical identifier matching the filename prefix (`RFC-NNNN`).                                                                                |
| `title`        | string          | Human-readable title (no `RFC-NNNN:` prefix — that's encoded in `id`).                                                                          |
| `status`       | enum            | One of the RFC Status Values above.                                                                                                            |
| `author`       | string          | Primary author name(s). Comma-separated for multi-author RFCs.                                                                                  |
| `created`      | ISO 8601 date   | When the RFC was first authored.                                                                                                                |
| `updated`      | ISO 8601 date   | Most recent substantive update.                                                                                                                 |
| `requiresDocs` | array of enum   | Closed enum declaring which user-facing doc surfaces must reference this RFC. See "requiresDocs values" below. `[]` is valid for purely strategic RFCs. |

### Optional fields

| Field                  | Type           | Notes                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `targetSpecVersion`    | string         | Spec API version targeted (e.g. `v1alpha1`). Recommended.                                                                                              |
| `requires`             | array of RFC ID | RFCs this RFC depends on (e.g. RFC-0006 requires RFC-0002 and RFC-0004).                                                                              |
| `amends`               | array of RFC ID | RFCs this RFC amends (e.g. RFC-0010 amends RFC-0002).                                                                                                  |
| `deferredDocs`         | boolean        | Escape hatch — see below.                                                                                                                              |
| `deferredDocsDeadline` | ISO 8601 date   | Required when `deferredDocs: true`.                                                                                                                    |

### `requiresDocs` values

The closed enum is captured in the JSON schema. Each value maps to a `docs/` subdirectory:

| Value              | Maps to              | Use when…                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tutorial`         | `docs/tutorials/`    | A walkthrough is needed to teach the new capability.                                                     |
| `operator-runbook` | `docs/operations/`   | Operators (anyone running the orchestrator in production) need a how-to-operate guide.                  |
| `api-reference`    | `docs/api-reference/` | The RFC introduces or changes a programmatic surface (TypeScript types, schemas, runtime APIs).         |
| `getting-started`  | `docs/getting-started/` | The RFC affects the first-run path / onboarding.                                                      |
| `example`          | `docs/examples/`     | A worked example file (config, code, transcript) is needed to show real usage.                          |

For each value listed in an RFC's `requiresDocs`, **at least one file** in the corresponding subdirectory MUST reference the RFC by its `id` (literal text, e.g. `RFC-0006`). The CI script in AISDLC-69.3 enforces this; AISDLC-69.2 (this PR) defines the convention.

### Deferred docs escape hatch

Some RFCs are sign-off-finalised before the matching docs can reasonably be authored — for example, when the spec is locked but the reference implementation is still in flight. For those:

```yaml
requiresDocs:
  - tutorial
  - operator-runbook
deferredDocs: true
deferredDocsDeadline: 2026-06-30
```

CI passes but logs a warning that grows louder as the deadline approaches. Hard enforcement of the deadline is intentionally deferred to a future task — for now this is a forcing function, not a gate.

### Operator process — when authoring an RFC

1. Copy `RFC-0001-template.md` and fill in the YAML frontmatter at the top.
2. Pick the `status` value that matches your phase (`Draft` for new work) AND set the `lifecycle` field (also `Draft` for new work — see the [RFC Lifecycle (AISDLC-118)](#rfc-lifecycle-aisdlc-118) section above).
3. Decide which doc surfaces the RFC needs by walking through the `requiresDocs` enum. Pick the smallest set that covers the user-visible impact — empty (`[]`) is acceptable and correct for purely strategic / conceptual RFCs (e.g. RFC-0013 product strategy).
4. **Land the draft on main early.** As soon as the structure is shareable (typically after the first internal pass), open a PR that merges the RFC to main with `lifecycle: Draft`. Stakeholders can then reference it at the canonical `spec/rfcs/RFC-NNNN-*.md` URL while you iterate. Sign-off no longer gates visibility.
5. As the design matures, flip `lifecycle` through the states (Draft → Ready for Review → Signed Off → Implemented) via subsequent PRs that update the frontmatter alongside the per-owner sign-off checklist in the body.
6. **Before requesting `Approved` status**, ensure each surface in `requiresDocs` has at least one doc file referencing the RFC by its `id`. If the docs aren't ready, set `deferredDocs: true` with a deadline AND file a backlog task for the gap (so the orchestrator can eventually pick it up).
7. When the spec lands and the docs exist, flip `status` to `Implemented` (or `Final` for sign-off-gated RFCs), set `lifecycle: Implemented`, and remove `deferredDocs` if it was set.

## File Naming

RFC files follow the pattern:

```
RFC-NNNN-short-title.md
```

- `NNNN` is a zero-padded sequential number
- `short-title` is a lowercase, hyphenated summary (e.g., `custom-resource-types`)

## Claiming an RFC number (AISDLC-165)

Numbers are allocated **sequentially**. The single source of truth is the [Registry](#registry) table below — if your number isn't in the registry, you do not own it. To claim a number, you must EITHER:

1. **Open a PR** that adds your RFC file at `spec/rfcs/RFC-NNNN-<slug>.md` AND adds the registry row pointing to your filename, OR
2. **Reserve** by opening a PR that just adds a registry row marked `Status: Reserved` / `Lifecycle: Placeholder` with a one-line description in the Notes column of what you intend to write. Reserved entries hold the number while the design matures; promote to a real entry by amending the row when the file lands.

To pick the next available number: scan the registry, take the highest number, add 1. If two PRs claim the same number simultaneously, the one that lands first wins; the loser must rename. Reserved numbers may be released back to the pool by removing the row (or marking `Status: Released` and garbage-collecting later).

The registry covers four states:

- **Active** — the RFC file exists and is in some lifecycle phase (Draft / Ready for Review / Signed Off / Implemented).
- **Reserved** — number is held; no file yet. Notes column explains the intended scope.
- **Withdrawn** — number was claimed but the work was folded into another RFC or abandoned. The number is NOT recycled (slot collisions are confusing — see RFC-0003 / RFC-0013 history).
- **Template** — RFC-0001 only.

## Registry

The `OQs` column reports **unresolved open questions** per RFC. Source-of-truth is the RFC body's Open Questions section (typically §13 / §14 / §15). `0` means all OQs are resolved; `—` means the RFC has no OQ section (template, reserved-without-file, or non-normative strategic RFC). For the per-RFC OQ breakdown see [Open Questions Inventory](#open-questions-inventory); for the dependency graph rooted at RFC-0035 see [Critical Path to RFC-0035](#critical-path-to-rfc-0035-decision-catalog).

**Next available number:** RFC-0037.

> **Historical note (RFC-0003 collision):** Two different proposals (`-infrastructure-adapters` and `-product-first-implementation-strategy`) were both numbered 0003. AISDLC-109 resolved the collision by renumbering the product-strategy RFC to RFC-0013; RFC-0003 now refers unambiguously to the infrastructure-adapters RFC. Numbers are NOT recycled — slot collisions are confusing, so withdrawn entries keep their row in the registry.

## Open Questions Inventory

> **Audited:** 2026-05-13 (manual). Until [RFC-0035](RFC-0035-decision-catalog-operator-routing.md) ships the Decision Catalog, this section is regenerated by hand when meaningful RFC churn happens. Source-of-truth for each OQ is the body of the linked RFC; titles below are summarized.
>
> **Totals:** 31 active RFCs audited (excluding template + reservation-only entries). **~107 unresolved OQs**, **~123 resolved**. RFC-0029 has no OQ section by design (vision doc; positions stated). 2026-05-13 retrofit closed 15 OQs across RFC-0002 / RFC-0003 / RFC-0004 / RFC-0005 / RFC-0013 against shipped implementation; 2026-05-15 operator walkthrough closed all 12 in RFC-0024 AND all 14 in RFC-0035 AND all 10 in RFC-0025 (all three lifecycles promoted Draft → Ready for Review). RFC-0024 was prematurely flipped to `Implemented` by AISDLC-269 against 2026-05-13 first-pass resolutions; the 2026-05-15 walkthrough revised 7/12 OQs and rolled the lifecycle back to `Ready for Review` pending the RFC-0024 Refit (AISDLC-320 / 321 + 275-278). Remaining residuals documented in *Design locked* below.

### Awaiting lifecycle promotion (0 OQs; sign-off mechanics only)

OQs are resolved; what remains is per-owner sign-off ceremony, not new design work.

- **RFC-0009** Tessellated Design Intent — Lifecycle: Ready for Review. v3.4 resolves all 13 OQs; awaiting Product (Alex) sign-off on v3.4.
- **RFC-0016** Estimation Calibration (T-Shirt Sizes) — Lifecycle: Ready for Review. All 8 OQs resolved via operator walkthrough 2026-05-03.
- **RFC-0024** Emergent Issue Capture + Triage — Lifecycle: Ready for Review (promoted 2026-05-15). All 12 OQs resolved via operator walkthrough; §15.1 codifies timebox + default-on-silence convention with per-org configurability. Substrate partially shipped (`detector.ts` + `corpus/aggregate.ts`); authoring CLI + triage flow tracked in AISDLC-269.
- **RFC-0035** Decision Catalog and Operator Decision Routing — Lifecycle: Ready for Review (promoted 2026-05-15). All 14 OQs resolved via operator walkthrough; §15.1 codifies the 8 normative design patterns (event-sourcing, clean Task/Decision separation, auto-apply with override window, shared LLM classifier corpus, composition over duplication, per-org configurability, fatigue-aware non-blocking, deterministic-first ladder). Implementation per §14 plan; design contract is the substrate every future operator-decision-pending subsystem composes against.

### Design locked (residual OQs are implementation refinements)

These RFCs are Signed Off or Implemented. Remaining OQs are implementation-tier questions; they do not affect downstream RFCs' design contracts.

- **RFC-0002** Pipeline Orchestration Policy — Lifecycle: Implemented (retrofit 2026-05-13). 1 residual: OQ-3 `onTimeout: escalate` runtime not wired — the schema enum lands but `ApprovalWorkflow` has no timeout reconciler; RFC-0015's PR-labeling is the de-facto escalation path.
- **RFC-0003** Infrastructure Provider Adapters — Lifecycle: Implemented (retrofit 2026-05-13). All 3 OQs resolved as "stay simple" (no transactions, no ack, no versioning); design closed. RFC-0010 §13 `HarnessAdapter` is orthogonal, not superseding.
- **RFC-0004** Cost Governance and Attribution — Lifecycle: Implemented (retrofit 2026-05-13). 3 deferred OQs: OQ-1 humanReviewCost compute, OQ-2 cross-provider normalization, OQ-5 infrastructure cost allocation — all revisitable when a concrete consumer materializes. RFC-0032 (Draft) extends, does NOT supersede.
- **RFC-0005** Product Priority Algorithm — Lifecycle: Signed Off (retrofit 2026-05-13). Admission subset wired (`orchestrator/src/admission-composite.ts`, `sa-scoring/`); full runtime composite deferred to PPA v1.1 per RFC-0008 §17. 2 deferred OQs: OQ-2 lifecycle weights for non-Eρ₄ dimensions, OQ-5 calibration data retention.
- **RFC-0013** AI-SDLC Orchestrator Product Strategy — Lifecycle: Implemented (retrofit 2026-05-13). `@ai-sdlc/orchestrator` v0.10.0 ships the strategy. All 3 OQs resolved: OQ-1 license = Apache-2.0 (CHARTER.md CNCF alignment); OQ-2 per-pipeline cost attribution shipped (`CostTracker` + `cost_ledger` + `CostGovernancePlugin`); OQ-3 AAIF moot (project targets CNCF Sandbox, not AAIF).
- **RFC-0006** Design System Governance — Lifecycle: Implemented. 1 partial OQ (Q7 autonomy-threshold tooling decision); design locked.
- **RFC-0007** Figma Make Pipeline Integration — Lifecycle: Signed Off. 5 OQs framed as "must be resolved before advancing from draft," but RFC is Signed Off; treat as implementation-refinement queue.
- **RFC-0011** DoR Gate — Lifecycle: Implemented (lifecycle audit 2026-05-13 promoted Signed Off → Implemented). AISDLC-115 umbrella + all 9 phases 115.1–115.9 shipped; `evaluationMode: enforce` live in dogfood. 1 partial OQ (Q10 cost confirmation deferred to Phase 2b).
- **RFC-0012** Two-Tier Pipeline Architecture — Lifecycle: Implemented (lifecycle audit 2026-05-13 promoted Signed Off → Implemented per operator confirmation). pipeline-cli is the production runtime substrate; phase tasks AISDLC-100.{1,2,3,5,6,7,8} + Codex adaptation 202.{1-4} shipped. Umbrella-task close-out lost in re-org but the two-tier contract runs every `/ai-sdlc execute` today. 4 implementation-tier residuals (subagent invocation discovery, per-tenant spawner config, integration testing without quota burn, plugin install path).
- **RFC-0014** Dependency Graph Composition — Lifecycle: Implemented (lifecycle audit 2026-05-13 promoted Draft → Implemented). AISDLC-167 umbrella + all 5 phases 167.1–167.5 shipped; `AI_SDLC_DEPS_COMPOSITION` flag stays opt-in per operator decision 2026-05-10.
- **RFC-0015** Autonomous Pipeline Orchestrator — Lifecycle: Signed Off (lifecycle audit 2026-05-13 promoted Ready for Review → Signed Off). AISDLC-169 umbrella + all 5 phases 169.1–169.5 shipped behind `AI_SDLC_AUTONOMOUS_ORCHESTRATOR=experimental`. Flag default-on promotion gated on AISDLC-253 fixture-leak fix + fresh corpus, not on implementation gap.
- **RFC-0023** Operator TUI — Lifecycle: Signed Off (lifecycle audit 2026-05-13 promoted Ready for Review → Signed Off). AISDLC-178 umbrella + all 7 phases 178.1–178.7 + extension 178.4.1 shipped.

## Critical Path to RFC-0035 (Decision Catalog)

This section computes the dependency chain that must be design-stable for **RFC-0035 (Decision Catalog and Operator Decision Routing)** to ship. Source: `requires:` frontmatter edges, traced transitively. Two milestones are distinct:

1. **Sign-off-ready** — RFC-0035's direct dependencies are Signed Off (or Ready for Review with no open design questions) so the contract surface is stable. This is the near-term milestone the operator burns OQs to reach.
2. **Implementation-ready** — the dependent infrastructure (DoR Gate, dep graph, TUI, emergent-capture) is shipped to a degree that RFC-0035's Phase 1-11 implementation plan can land. This follows sign-off and is driven by milestone tracking, not OQ debt.

### Critical-path status table

The rows are listed in dependency order (ancestors first). The **Blocks RFC-0035?** column reports whether the RFC's current state blocks RFC-0035's near-term sign-off.

| RFC | Title | Lifecycle | Unresolved OQs | Blocks RFC-0035 sign-off? | Recommended next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RFC-0008 | PPA Triad | Implemented | 0 | No | — |
| RFC-0009 | Tessellated Design Intent | Ready for Review | 0 | No (transitive only) | Land Alex's Product sign-off on v3.4 |
| RFC-0011 | DoR Gate | Implemented | 1 partial | No | Q10 confirmation deferred to Phase 2b — non-blocking |
| RFC-0023 | Operator TUI | Signed Off | 0 | No (direct dep, design locked) | Implementation phases 178.1–178.7 shipped; flag promotion follows opt-in pattern |
| RFC-0024 | Emergent Issue Capture | Ready for Review | 0 | No (direct dep, design locked) | All 12 OQs resolved 2026-05-15; lifecycle promoted to Ready for Review; awaits per-owner sign-off |
| RFC-0029 | Product Pillar | Draft | — (no OQ section) | Yes — direct dep | Promote to Signed Off (Product sign-off; vision doc, no OQ walkthrough needed) |
| RFC-0035 | Decision Catalog | Ready for Review | 0 | (target — design locked) | All 14 OQs resolved 2026-05-15; lifecycle promoted to Ready for Review; awaits per-owner sign-off |

### Action sequence (near-term decision burn)

The bulk of operator decision time before RFC-0035 sign-off is concentrated in two RFCs:

1. **RFC-0024 walkthrough** — 12 OQs. RFC-0035's `source: emergent-finding` feeder behavior depends on RFC-0024's capture / triage contract. Resolve first because RFC-0035 OQs (e.g. OQ-5 cross-source dedup, OQ-7 catalog vs projection) read out of RFC-0024's resolution.
2. **RFC-0035 walkthrough** — 14 OQs. Resolve after RFC-0024 lands so design coherence is preserved.

**Parallel sign-off ceremonies (no new design work):**

- RFC-0023 → Signed Off (Engineering + Operator + Product sign on §15 Resolved questions)
- RFC-0029 → Signed Off (Product sign-off; vision doc has no OQ surface)
- RFC-0009 → Signed Off (Alex's v3.4 Product sign-off)

**Total operator decision-burn for RFC-0035 sign-off: 0 OQs.** All 14 RFC-0035 OQs resolved 2026-05-15 via operator walkthrough; RFC-0024 also at Ready for Review (12/12 OQs resolved). Critical path is now per-owner sign-off only — no remaining design decisions block RFC-0035.

### What this section becomes once RFC-0035 ships

Once the Decision Catalog ships, this manually-curated section is replaced by a `cli-decisions critical-path --target RFC-0035` query that traverses the live catalog and the registry's `requires:` edges automatically. The Mermaid graph above is a snapshot — the live tool will regenerate it per-target on demand and reflect override events, deferred decisions, and capacity-aware prioritization (§7 of RFC-0035). For now, regenerate this section by hand when:

- A critical-path RFC's lifecycle changes (Draft → Ready for Review → Signed Off → Implemented)
- A critical-path RFC's OQs are resolved or new ones are added
- RFC-0035's `requires:` edges change
