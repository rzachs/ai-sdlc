# AI-SDLC Documentation

User-facing documentation for the AI-SDLC Framework.

> **Source of truth.** This directory (`ai-sdlc/docs/`) is the canonical source for all user-facing documentation. The published site at `ai-sdlc-io/content/docs/` is generated from these `.md` files via `pnpm docs:sync` (`scripts/docs-sync.mjs`). **Always edit here, never directly in `ai-sdlc-io`.**
>
> CI catches drift via `pnpm docs:check` (`scripts/check-docs-sync.mjs`). See [`backlog/decisions/AISDLC-68-documentation-consolidation.md`](../backlog/decisions/AISDLC-68-documentation-consolidation.md) for the architecture decision.
