# Orchestrator operator runbook

**Audience**: AI-SDLC operators running `cli-orchestrator tick` /
`cli-orchestrator start` against a real backlog, plus anyone diagnosing
events.jsonl after a failed run.

This runbook is the day-to-day companion to the promotion runbook at
[`orchestrator-promotion.md`](./orchestrator-promotion.md) and the spec
at [`spec/rfcs/RFC-0015-autonomous-pipeline-orchestrator.md`](../../spec/rfcs/RFC-0015-autonomous-pipeline-orchestrator.md).

## Full-pipeline umbrella dispatch (AISDLC-229)

As of AISDLC-229, `cli-orchestrator tick` dispatches tasks through the
`ai-sdlc-pipeline execute` umbrella (AISDLC-182) rather than shelling out
to `claude --print --agent developer` directly. This means each admitted
task now runs the full Step 0-13 pipeline:

- Step 7: spawn three reviewer subagents (code / test / security)
- Step 8: aggregate verdicts → write `.ai-sdlc/verdicts/<task-id-lower>.json`
- Step 10: sign DSSE attestation envelope
- Step 11: push branch + open PR
- Step 12: open sibling-repo PRs (when `permittedExternalPaths` declared)
- Step 13: cleanup `.active-task` sentinel

### Spawner choice: `AI_SDLC_ORCHESTRATOR_SPAWNER_FALLBACK`

The default spawner for the umbrella is `claude-cli` (inline manifest mode,
AISDLC-198). This requires the AISDLC-225 consumer bridge to be deployed so
that the dispatch manifest is actually consumed and subagents are invoked.

While AISDLC-225 is in flight (consumer bridge not yet shipped), you can
fall back to `api-key` billing by setting:

```bash
export AI_SDLC_ORCHESTRATOR_SPAWNER_FALLBACK=api-key
```

With this set, if the `claude-cli` spawner reports the consumer bridge is
missing, the orchestrator automatically retries the same task with `api-key`
(requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment). This incurs Anthropic API
costs (same billing model as `pnpm dogfood watch`), but lets unattended
orchestrator runs produce complete PRs today.

If `AI_SDLC_ORCHESTRATOR_SPAWNER_FALLBACK` is unset (the default) AND the
`claude-cli` spawner is unavailable, the dispatch records a failure in
`outcomes[i].failure` with `type: 'spawner-unavailable'` and continues to
the next admitted task — it never blocks the entire tick.

### `pipeline.*` outcome fields (AISDLC-229)

Each `outcomes[i]` entry in the tick result now carries optional `pipeline`
and `failure` fields populated from the umbrella's return envelope:

```json
{
  "taskId": "AISDLC-99",
  "outcome": "approved",
  "prUrl": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42",
  "pipeline": {
    "attestationSha": null,
    "prNumber": 42,
    "reviewerVerdicts": {
      "code": "approved",
      "test": "approved",
      "security": "approved"
    },
    "iterations": 2
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pipeline.attestationSha` | `string \| null` | HEAD SHA after the DSSE attestation chore commit. `null` when reviewers didn't run. |
| `pipeline.prNumber` | `number \| null` | GitHub PR number parsed from `prUrl`. `null` on failure paths. |
| `pipeline.reviewerVerdicts` | `{ code, test, security } \| null` | Per-reviewer `"approved"` or `"changes-requested"`. `null` when reviewers didn't run. |
| `pipeline.iterations` | `number \| null` | Number of review iterations the umbrella ran. `null` on pre-review failures. |

The `pipeline` field is `undefined` when:
- The legacy `dispatch` adapter was injected (backwards-compatible test paths).
- The umbrella failed before the review phase.

The `failure` field (when present):

```json
{
  "failure": {
    "type": "developer-failed",
    "message": "developer returned commitSha: null"
  }
}
```

| `failure.type` | Cause |
|---|---|
| `developer-failed` | Dev subagent returned `commitSha: null` (no work produced). |
| `developer-json-contract-violated` | Dev returned prose twice; umbrella gave up. |
| `aborted` | Push or `gh pr create` failed mid-flight. |
| `spawner-unavailable` | `claude-cli` spawner manifest not consumed; no fallback configured. |
| `unknown` | Catch-all for other umbrella failures. |

### What to do if the umbrella fails mid-tick

**If `failure.type === 'developer-failed'` or `aborted`:**
The orchestrator's AISDLC-177 rollback fires automatically: it reverts the
task status to its pre-dispatch value, removes the worktree, and
(if the dev produced commits) quarantines the branch under
`quarantine/<task-id-lower>-<ts>`. The next tick will re-pick the task.
See the "Recovering quarantined work" section below for forensic inspection.

**If `failure.type === 'spawner-unavailable'`:**
Set `AI_SDLC_ORCHESTRATOR_SPAWNER_FALLBACK=api-key` (see above) and
re-dispatch the task. Alternatively, wait for AISDLC-225 (consumer bridge)
to ship and then re-run.

**If `failure.type === 'unknown'`:**
Inspect the `message` field. Common causes:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` missing when `--spawner api-key` fallback was attempted.
- Validation failure in Step 1 (malformed task frontmatter).
- Network errors during `gh pr create`.

To re-dispatch manually, reset the task status to `To Do` (the rollback
does this automatically, but you can also do it via the plugin MCP tool):

```bash
mcp__plugin_ai-sdlc_ai-sdlc__task_edit AISDLC-99 --status "To Do"
```

## Inline orchestrator mode (`--spawner claude-cli`) (AISDLC-198)

The inline orchestrator is the recommended way to run the autonomous
orchestrator on **subscription billing** (Claude Code Max). It avoids
per-token API costs by running the orchestrator's tick loop INSIDE the
operator's Claude Code session instead of as a separate process.

### Why inline mode

The autonomous orchestrator (`cli-orchestrator`) needs to dispatch subagents
(developer, reviewers). Subagent dispatch via the `Agent` tool is only
available inside an active Claude Code session. Inline mode solves this
by making the slash command body the orchestrator process — see
[`docs/operations/claude-cli-spawner.md`](./claude-cli-spawner.md) for the
full option evaluation.

### Prerequisites

1. Claude Code Max subscription (any tier).
2. `AI_SDLC_AUTONOMOUS_ORCHESTRATOR=experimental` set in your shell
   (enables the `cli-orchestrator` feature gate — required by RFC-0015 §3.1).
3. Backlog with at least one task in `To Do` status.
4. Working directory is the project root (where `backlog/`, `.worktrees/`,
   and `artifacts/` live).

### Starting the inline orchestrator

In your Claude Code session, run the `/ai-sdlc execute` slash command in loop
mode:

```
/loop /ai-sdlc execute <task-id>
```

For autonomous multi-task orchestration (the full loop), the slash command body
reads the dispatch manifest written by `ClaudeCliInlineSpawner` and invokes the
Agent tool for each admitted task. The manifest is at:

```
artifacts/_orchestrator/dispatch-manifest.json
```

Between ticks the slash command uses `ScheduleWakeup` to yield without blocking.

### Monitoring inline orchestrator progress

Progress lines emitted by the orchestrator are in the format:

```
[ai-sdlc-progress] <stage>: <message>
```

The dispatch manifest written before each Agent call is at:

```bash
cat artifacts/_orchestrator/dispatch-manifest.json
```

Events are also written to `artifacts/_orchestrator/events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`:

```bash
tail -f artifacts/_orchestrator/events-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl | jq .
```

### How the dispatch manifest works

When the orchestrator runs with `--spawner claude-cli`, each dispatch slot
calls `ClaudeCliInlineSpawner.spawn()`, which writes a JSON manifest and
returns `status: 'manifest-emitted'`. The manifest shape:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "taskId": "AISDLC-123",
  "subagentType": "developer",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "prompt": "...",
  "cwd": "/path/to/worktree",
  "runInBackground": false,
  "emittedAt": "2026-05-05T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The calling slash command body reads the manifest and invokes the `Agent` tool
with the described parameters. This keeps all Agent-tool invocations inside the
Claude Code session (subscription billing) while letting the TypeScript
orchestrator handle scheduling, admission filters, and event emission.

### Stopping the inline orchestrator

The orchestrator tick loop stops when:
- `maxTicks` is reached (set via `--max-ticks N`).
- The operator sends `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) — the loop drains in-flight dispatches
  and exits cleanly.
- The slash command session ends (ScheduleWakeup will not fire again).

### Transitioning from manual dispatch to inline orchestrator

If you have been manually running `/ai-sdlc execute <task-id>` for each task:

1. Verify the inline orchestrator prerequisites above are met.
2. Start the loop (replace manual per-task invocations).
3. The orchestrator reads the backlog frontier and picks the next `To Do`
   task automatically — no manual task-id selection needed.

### Troubleshooting inline mode

**`manifest-emitted` status in pipeline logs**: This is expected in inline mode.
It means the spawner wrote the manifest; the slash command body must invoke
the Agent tool. If you see this in a non-inline context, the wrong spawner kind
was selected.

**Manifest file not found**: The manifest path defaults to
`$ARTIFACTS_DIR/_orchestrator/dispatch-manifest.json`. If `ARTIFACTS_DIR` is
unset it falls back to `<workDir>/artifacts/_orchestrator/`. Check that the
`artifacts/` directory is writable.

**Orchestrator not starting**: Verify `AI_SDLC_AUTONOMOUS_ORCHESTRATOR=experimental`
is set. The loop refuses to start when the flag is unset.

## Blocking a task from orchestrator dispatch (AISDLC-223)

The orchestrator's `Blocked` admission filter lets operators put a task on
hold without changing its status, removing it from the backlog, or modifying
the dependency graph. A blocked task is skipped on every tick until the
operator removes the `blocked.reason` field.

### When to use

- A task is "ready by all criteria" but you need to wait for an external
  signal before dispatching it — e.g. a soak window, a human decision, a
  dependency outside the task graph.
- AISDLC-115 is the canonical first user: RFC-0011 DoR Gate, soaking for
  promotion evidence. Mark it blocked until the soak window closes so the
  orchestrator stops re-picking it every tick.

### Frontmatter shape

Add a `blocked:` field to the task's YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: AISDLC-115
status: In Progress
blocked:
  reason: "Soaking — feature flag promotion gated on AISDLC-116 evidence"  # required
  until: "2026-05-13"           # optional advisory ISO date
  unblockedBy: ["AISDLC-116"]   # optional task IDs whose completion unblocks this
---
```

- `reason` (string, required) — any non-empty string activates the block.
  The orchestrator will emit this string verbatim in `TaskBlocked` events.
- `until` (string, optional) — an advisory ISO date. The orchestrator does
  NOT auto-unblock on this date (Phase 2 / AC #8); it is informational only
  and surfaces in `TaskBlocked` events + `cli-orchestrator status` output.
- `unblockedBy` (array, optional) — advisory task IDs to monitor. Same
  advisory semantics as `until` — no auto-unblock in v1.

### Editing the blocked field

Use `mcp__backlog__task_edit` or hand-edit the task file:

```bash
# Set the blocked field
mcp__backlog__task_edit AISDLC-115 blocked.reason "Soaking — gated on AISDLC-116"

# Or hand-edit the YAML frontmatter in backlog/tasks/aisdlc-115 - *.md
```

### Unblocking a task

Remove the `blocked` field (or set `blocked.reason` to an empty string):

```bash
# Remove the field entirely via task_edit
mcp__backlog__task_edit AISDLC-115 blocked null

# Or hand-edit: delete the blocked: block from the YAML frontmatter
```

The next orchestrator tick will admit the task normally (all other filters
still apply).

### Observability: TaskBlocked events

Every tick that the `Blocked` filter rejects a task emits a `TaskBlocked`
event to `artifacts/_orchestrator/events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`:

```json
{
  "type": "TaskBlocked",
  "ts": "2026-05-06T12:34:56Z",
  "taskId": "AISDLC-115",
  "reason": "Soaking — feature flag promotion gated on AISDLC-116 evidence",
  "until": "2026-05-13"
}
```

Grep for blocked tasks across all event files:

```bash
grep '"TaskBlocked"' artifacts/_orchestrator/events-*.jsonl | jq .
```

### Observability: cli-orchestrator status

`cli-orchestrator status` includes a `blocked` array in its JSON output:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "mode": "status",
  "status": {
    "blocked": [
      {
        "taskId": "AISDLC-115",
        "reason": "Soaking — feature flag promotion gated on AISDLC-116 evidence",
        "until": "2026-05-13"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

An empty `"blocked": []` means no frontier tasks are currently blocked.

## Recovering quarantined work after a failed dispatch (AISDLC-177)

When the orchestrator dispatches a task and the dispatcher (Step 6
parse, the dev subagent itself, or any later step) reports a
non-recoverable failure — `developer-failed`,
`developer-json-contract-violated`, `aborted`, or an uncatalogued
exception — the orchestrator now **rolls back** Step 4's side-effects
automatically:

1. Reverts the task file's `status:` line back to whatever it was
   BEFORE the orchestrator picked the task (typically `To Do`).
2. Removes the worktree at `.worktrees/<task-id-lower>/` via
   `git worktree remove --force`. The per-worktree `.active-task`
   sentinel goes with it.
3. **Preserves any commits the dev produced** by renaming the dev's
   branch under `quarantine/<task-id-lower>-<iso-timestamp>` instead
   of deleting it. This is the recovery path operators care about.
4. Emits an `OrchestratorRollback` event on the events.jsonl bus +
   (when commits were preserved) an `OrchestratorWorkQuarantined`
   companion event with the SHA + commit count.

### Step 1: identify a quarantined ref

Either:

- **From events.jsonl** — grep for the quarantine event:
  ```bash
  grep '"OrchestratorWorkQuarantined"' artifacts/_orchestrator/events-*.jsonl
  ```
  Each line carries `taskId`, `branch` (the original
  `ai-sdlc/<id-lower>` ref name), `quarantineRef`, `commitSha`, and
  `commitCount`.

- **From git** — list every quarantine ref directly:
  ```bash
  git branch --list 'quarantine/*'
  ```
  Refs are named `quarantine/<task-id-lower>-<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-mmm>`
  (UTC, millisecond precision per AISDLC-186). The timestamp suffix is
  the rollback wall-clock, not the commit's authored time. Pre-186 refs
  used second precision (`...T14-23-44`) and may still be present in
  long-lived repos — both formats sort lexicographically by date so
  `git branch --list` returns them interleaved as expected.

### Step 2: inspect the preserved work

```bash
git log quarantine/aisdlc-70-2026-05-04T14-23-44 --not origin/main --oneline
```

If the commits look salvageable, check out a fresh feature branch from
the quarantine ref:

```bash
git checkout -b ai-sdlc/aisdlc-70-recovered quarantine/aisdlc-70-2026-05-04T14-23-44
```

Carry the change forward yourself:

- Cherry-pick into a fresh worktree if the dev's work was almost
  complete but hit a non-deterministic failure.
- Open a PR manually if the commits already pass review locally.
- Discard the ref if the work was wrong-headed (the orchestrator did
  the right thing flagging it):
  ```bash
  git branch -D quarantine/aisdlc-70-2026-05-04T14-23-44
  ```

### Step 3: re-dispatch the task (optional)

The original task's status was reverted to `To Do` by the rollback,
so the next orchestrator tick will pick it up again automatically.
If you want to skip re-dispatch (because you're carrying the work
forward yourself), set the status to `In Progress` manually so the
admission filters skip it:

```bash
# via the plugin MCP tool inside Claude Code
mcp__plugin_ai-sdlc_ai-sdlc__task_edit AISDLC-70 --status "In Progress"
```

### What the rollback does NOT touch

- **`approved` outcomes** — the dev's PR is already opened, no
  rollback fires. The worktree is swept by the normal Step 13 cleanup.
- **`needs-human-attention` outcomes** — the orchestrator deliberately
  leaves the worktree intact so the operator can iterate from where
  the dev stopped. The PR carries a `needs-human-attention` label
  (RFC-0015 §13 Q1).
- **`task-already-in-flight` rejections** — no dispatch happened,
  nothing to roll back. The pre-dispatch filter catches these
  silently with an `OrchestratorTaskAlreadyInFlight` event.
- **Filter-chain rejections** (`OrchestratorBlockedByDependency`,
  `OrchestratorBlockedByDor`, `OrchestratorAwaitingExternal`,
  `OrchestratorOrphanParent`) — the orchestrator never invoked
  Step 4, so there's nothing to roll back.

### Failure modes inside rollback itself

The rollback helper is best-effort: every step (status revert, branch
quarantine probe, worktree removal) runs in its own try/catch, and
warnings accumulate in the `OrchestratorRollback` event's payload
(via the orchestrator's `warn()` log). A partial rollback will still
emit the event so operators see the partial state — the warnings are
the diagnostic, not the absence of the event.

The event payload itself carries booleans for each side-effect so
operators can detect a partial rollback without grep'ing logs:

- **`statusReverted`** (AISDLC-186) — `true` when the task file's
  `status:` line was successfully patched back to `fromStatus`. When
  `false`, the task file write failed (file disappeared mid-run,
  frontmatter became unparseable, disk error). Note that `toStatus`
  reports the INTENDED post-rollback status and mirrors `fromStatus`
  even on failure — the on-disk reality is in `statusReverted`. When
  `false`, manually reset the task status (`mcp__backlog__task_edit
  <id> --status <fromStatus>`).
- **`worktreeRemoved`** — `true` when `git worktree remove --force`
  succeeded (or the path was already absent). `false` indicates the
  worktree directory is still on disk + still registered with git.
- **`branchQuarantined`** — `true` when the dev's branch carried
  commits beyond `origin/main` AND the rename to
  `quarantine/<ref>` succeeded. `false` is the common case (no
  commits to preserve) but can also indicate a rename failure —
  cross-reference the warnings to disambiguate.

Common partial-rollback warnings:

| Warning | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `task file not found for <id>` | Backlog task file moved/deleted between Step 4 and rollback. | Manual `mcp__backlog__task_edit` to set status. |
| `worktree remove failed: <stderr>` | Worktree directory locked (e.g. an editor has files open) or already unregistered from `git worktree list`. | `git worktree prune` then `rm -rf .worktrees/<id-lower>` manually. |
| `quarantine rename failed: <stderr>` | Target ref already exists (would require two rollbacks for the same task within the same UTC millisecond per AISDLC-186 — practically impossible) or the branch was deleted by an external process between probe + rename. | Inspect `git reflog show ai-sdlc/<id-lower>` to recover the SHA, then `git branch quarantine/<id>-<ts> <sha>`. |

---

## Auto-cleanup of stale worktree branches (AISDLC-224)

When the autonomous orchestrator dispatches a task and Step 3 (`git worktree add`)
fails because the target branch already exists from a prior aborted session, the
orchestrator can self-heal by cleaning up the stale branch and retrying — instead
of returning `{ outcome: 'aborted' }` and re-failing on every subsequent tick.

### Feature flag

Auto-cleanup is **off by default**. Opt in by setting:

```bash
export AI_SDLC_ORCHESTRATOR_AUTO_CLEANUP=1
```

Canonical truthy values: `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` (case-insensitive). Any other
value (including unset) leaves cleanup disabled and behavior is unchanged from
before AISDLC-224.

The flag only takes effect when the orchestrator is also running in autonomous
mode (i.e., invoked via `cli-orchestrator tick` / `cli-orchestrator start`). The
manual `/ai-sdlc execute` slash command path always leaves `autonomousMode` false
and is unaffected regardless of the flag.

### How it works

When `git worktree add` exits non-zero with a "branch already exists" stderr
pattern, AND `autonomousMode === true`, AND `AI_SDLC_ORCHESTRATOR_AUTO_CLEANUP`
is truthy, Step 3 runs three safety predicates before attempting any cleanup:

1. **Open-PR check** — `gh pr list --head <branch> --state open` must return
   empty. An open PR means the operator's in-flight work is associated with this
   branch and clobbering it would destroy review history.

2. **Uncommitted-changes check** — `git -C <worktree-path> status --porcelain`
   must return empty. Uncommitted changes represent potential data loss if the
   worktree is forcibly removed.

3. **Branch-checked-out-elsewhere check** — `git worktree list --porcelain` must
   NOT show the branch mounted at a different path. If it does, another worktree
   (possibly a parallel dispatch) is actively using the branch.

All three predicates must pass. If ANY predicate fails, cleanup is skipped and
the original "branch already exists" error propagates (same behavior as before
AISDLC-224).

When all three pass, the cleanup sequence runs:
1. `git worktree remove --force <.worktrees/<task-id>/>`
2. `git branch -D <branch>`
3. `git worktree add <.worktrees/<task-id>> -b <branch> origin/main` (one retry)
4. If retry also fails → original error is re-raised (no looping)

### WorktreeAutoCleaned event

When cleanup fires, a `WorktreeAutoCleaned` event is emitted on the
`events.jsonl` bus:

```jsonc
{
  "ts": "2026-05-06T12:34:56.789Z",
  "type": "WorktreeAutoCleaned",
  "taskId": "AISDLC-99",
  "branch": "ai-sdlc/aisdlc-99",
  "reason": "branch already exists",
  "hadOpenPR": false,           // always false when cleanup proceeded
  "hadUncommittedChanges": false // always false when cleanup proceeded
}
```

Grep for it:

```bash
jq -c 'select(.type == "WorktreeAutoCleaned")' \
  artifacts/_orchestrator/events-*.jsonl
```

A high frequency of `WorktreeAutoCleaned` events for the same `taskId` across
multiple days indicates the rollback mechanism (AISDLC-177) may not be
completing cleanly — investigate the `OrchestratorRollback` events for that
task to see if worktree removal or branch deletion failed.

### Safety rationale

The three predicates are designed so the orchestrator can only auto-clean
worktrees that are provably inert:

| Predicate | What it protects |
|---|---|
| Open-PR check | In-flight operator review — never silently close a PR's source branch |
| Uncommitted-changes check | Potential developer work that wasn't committed before the prior session crashed |
| Branch-checked-out-elsewhere | A parallel dispatch or manual operator session using the same branch |

If the auto-cleanup ever misbehaves (e.g. false-negative on an open-PR check due
to a `gh` network failure), the conservative fallback is the pre-AISDLC-224
behavior: the error surfaces, the task gets re-picked on the next tick, and the
operator sees repeated `aborted` outcomes for the same task — noisy but safe.

---

## Counting developer-contract retries by code path (AISDLC-196)

When the developer subagent returns non-JSON prose, the Step 6 retry
helper re-prompts for the JSON envelope and — if the dev recovers — the
orchestrator emits a `DeveloperContractRetry` event onto the
`events.jsonl` bus. Two code paths fire this event:

- **Initial-dispatch path** (`phase: 'initial'`) — Step 5b/6 of
  `executePipeline()`, on the very first dev call for the task.
  Frequent emission here points at developer.md system-prompt drift
  (the agent forgot the JSON contract often enough that the retry is
  doing more work than it should).
- **Iteration-loop path** (`phase: 'iteration'`, plus an `iteration`
  field carrying the actual loop counter, always >=2) — Step 9 of the
  iteration loop, when the dev returns prose on a re-dispatch after a
  CHANGES_REQUESTED round. Frequent emission here points at
  post-feedback re-dispatch fragility (long feedback prompts pushing
  the agent off the contract), not initial-prompt drift.

Operator queries against the date-rotated events files:

```bash
# All DeveloperContractRetry events across every rotated file:
jq -c 'select(.type == "DeveloperContractRetry")' \
  artifacts/_orchestrator/events-*.jsonl

# Iteration-path retries only — surfaces post-feedback re-dispatch drift:
jq -c 'select(.type == "DeveloperContractRetry" and .phase == "iteration")' \
  artifacts/_orchestrator/events-*.jsonl

# Initial-dispatch retries only — surfaces developer.md prompt drift:
jq -c 'select(.type == "DeveloperContractRetry" and .phase == "initial")' \
  artifacts/_orchestrator/events-*.jsonl

# Per-iteration histogram (iteration 2, 3, ... = which feedback round
# tripped the contract most often):
jq -r 'select(.type == "DeveloperContractRetry" and .phase == "iteration") | .iteration' \
  artifacts/_orchestrator/events-*.jsonl | sort | uniq -c
```

The `phase` + `iteration` discriminators are additive (AISDLC-196):
events emitted before the discriminator landed simply omit the fields,
so the queries above implicitly bucket pre-discriminator events into
neither group. Any persistent imbalance between the two paths is the
signal — pick the one with the higher count and address its drift
source first.
