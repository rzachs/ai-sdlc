## Final Summary

RFC-0042 Phase 3 cutover implemented. Default schema version is now v6 (Merkle-transcript-based). AISDLC-380 sub-attestation gate downgraded to audit-only. AISDLC-380.2 marked Superseded. CLAUDE.md and operator runbook updated. Hermetic tests updated and new cutover tests added.

### Changes

- `ai-sdlc-plugin/scripts/sign-attestation.mjs`: Default schema version flipped from v5 to v6.
- `scripts/check-attestation-sign.sh`: Step 4d downgraded to audit-only. v6 mode: gate skipped entirely. v5 mode: failures emit WARN + exit 0. Idempotency and stale-envelope detection handle both `.dsse.json` (v5) and `.v6.dsse.json` (v6).
- `backlog/completed/aisdlc-380.2 - ...`: AISDLC-380.2 moved to completed with status Superseded.
- `CLAUDE.md`: Attestation section updated — v6 is the default, v3/v4/v5 verifier retained, gate is audit-only.
- `docs/operations/reviewer-signing-key-runbook.md`: Added DEPRECATED banner.
- `scripts/check-attestation-sign.test.mjs`: Updated for v6 default + new cutover tests.

### ACs met

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7



## Scope (RFC-0042 Phase 3)

Per RFC-0042 §Migration Phase 3, perform the cutover: new PRs use only v6 envelopes; the AISDLC-380 sub-attestation gate becomes audit-only (warns but does not block).

### Deliverables

1. **Default schema version** in `sign-attestation.mjs` flipped from v5 to v6
2. **AISDLC-380 sub-attestation gate** (`scripts/verify-reviewer-sub-attestations.mjs` + `scripts/check-attestation-sign.sh` Step 4d) downgraded:
   - On v6 envelopes: gate skipped entirely (v6 has its own verification)
   - On v5 envelopes: gate still runs but failures emit warning, exit 0 (audit-only mode)
3. **AISDLC-380.2 task** marked Superseded — replaced by RFC-0042 (file in backlog/completed/ with finalSummary noting the supersession)
4. **CLAUDE.md attestation section** updated:
   - v6 is the default
   - v3/v4/v5 verifier code retained per OQ-7
   - AISDLC-380 sub-attestation gate is audit-only
5. **Operator runbook update**: any operator following AISDLC-380 onboarding flow gets a deprecation note pointing at RFC-0042 transcript-based flow
6. Hermetic tests: v5 envelope with no sub-attestations + AISDLC-380 gate downgraded → push succeeds (would have failed pre-cutover)

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] #1 New PRs produce v6 envelopes by default
- [ ] #2 AISDLC-380 sub-attestation gate emits warnings only; no longer blocks pushes
- [ ] #3 AISDLC-380.2 task marked Superseded in `backlog/completed/`
- [ ] #4 CLAUDE.md attestation section reflects post-cutover state
- [ ] #5 Operator runbook updated; AISDLC-380 onboarding flow is deprecated
- [ ] #6 Hermetic tests cover cutover behavior
- [ ] #7 New code reaches 80%+ patch coverage

## Out of scope

- Deleting v3/v4/v5 signer code (deferred to AISDLC-383.7 after 30-day soak)
- Deleting AISDLC-380 sub-attestation code (deferred to AISDLC-383.7)
- Deleting `init-reviewer-signing-key.mjs` (deferred to AISDLC-383.7)

## Source

RFC-0042 §Migration Phase 3. Cutover marks the point where new PRs benefit from RFC-0042 while legacy PRs continue verifying via the retained v3/v4/v5 code.
