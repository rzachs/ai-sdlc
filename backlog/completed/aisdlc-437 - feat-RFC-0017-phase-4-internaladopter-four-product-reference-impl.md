    Upstream-OQ gate override: (1) RFC-0017 frontmatter `lifecycle:` field
    is stale at 'Ready for Review' but the body header reads `**Lifecycle:**
    Signed Off` after the 2026-05-26 v0.4 sign-off from all three Authority
    pillars (Mo conditional, Dominique Engineering, Alex Product) per the
    Sign-Off table. RFC-0017 v0.4.3 explicitly notes Mo's condition #1
    discharges when AISDLC-437 ships — this task is the discharge mechanism.
    (2) RFC-0018 is referenced only in body text as a "ProductD deferred to
    RFC-0018" note explaining scope reduction; it is NOT a runtime dependency
    of this task's implementation. Frontmatter `references:` correctly lists
    only RFC-0017.

## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Phase 4 of RFC-0017 §9 + §11 practitioner validation. Implements InternalAdopter's four-product suite as the reference implementation; validates the variant pattern against real-world adopter constraints before final sign-off.

## Scope (§11 validation criteria)

- **ProductA**: variants `small-utility`, `enterprise`, `county-regional` — validates audience-segment specialization across the v0.4 visual-token surface (color/density/typography/motion/radius).
- **ProductB**: variants `field-tech-on-truck`, `field-tech-handheld`, `supervisor-tablet` — validates density profile + form-factor specialization.
- **ProductC**: variants `billing-clerk`, `customer-portal`, `csr-dashboard` — validates role-based audience + workflow-density specialization.
- **ProductD**: **DEFERRED to RFC-0018 §11** per v0.4 Design Authority editorial pass. Proposed variants (`annual-test`, `repair-event`, `regulatory-audit-mode`) are temporal-context-bound operational modes activated by *when* and *why* a user is in the system — same user, different operational moment = Journey shape (RFC-0018), not Variant shape. ProductD validates the Variant/Journey boundary as a validation case for the companion RFC, not this one. **Scope of this task is now three products (A, B, C), not four.**

## Validation criteria (Mo's editorial welcome)

1. Each variant's design intent articulable in ≤ 5 `designImperatives` strings
2. No variant uses a field outside the §6.1 schema (closed-enum holds; OR validates the vendor-prefix extension path from OQ-5 if a real bespoke field surfaces)
3. Admission scoring on a real work item (e.g., "small-utility onboarding improvement") produces a different + better-justified score than soul-aggregate scoring
4. Engineering vertex confirms substrate is genuinely shared across all variants of each soul (no hidden divergence)
5. Deprecation lifecycle test: deprecate a variant; verify consumers degrade gracefully through full G0-routed lifecycle.

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 ProductA variant declarations ship with `small-utility` / `enterprise` / `county-regional`
- [x] #2 ProductB variant declarations ship with `field-tech-on-truck` / `field-tech-handheld` / `supervisor-tablet`
- [x] #3 ProductC variant declarations ship with `billing-clerk` / `customer-portal` / `csr-dashboard`
- [x] #4 ProductD scope removed from this task per v0.4 (deferred to RFC-0018 §11 — temporal-context-bound modes are Journey shape, not Variant). File follow-up task against RFC-0018 once that RFC's implementation plan is broken down.
- [x] #5 Each variant has ≤ 5 `designImperatives` strings (validates closed-enum discipline OR exercises vendor-prefix extension)
- [x] #6 Admission scoring spot-check: variant-routed score differs from soul-aggregate by ≥ X% on a representative work item
- [x] #7 Engineering review confirms substrate shared across all four products' variants
- [x] #8 End-to-end deprecation lifecycle test on one ProductA variant
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Shipped as `orchestrator/src/variant/internal-adopter/` module:

- `products.ts` — declarative ProductA/B/C fixtures with shared `INTERNAL_ADOPTER_SUBSTRATE` constant (single-reference substrate-sharing proof for AC #7); 9 variants total, each ≤ 5 `designImperatives` per AC #5
- `products.test.ts` — AC #1, #2, #3, #5, #7 coverage; runs `validateVariantDeclarations()` as defense-in-depth
- `admission-spotcheck.test.ts` — AC #6 with 20% deviation threshold (X parameter justified inline against RFC-0008 Sα₂ calibration ranges); exercises `computeVariantScopedScores()` on representative work items
- `deprecation-lifecycle.test.ts` — AC #8 end-to-end lifecycle (declared → approaching → removal-pending → removed) on ProductA's `county-regional` variant; verifies G0 non-blocking invariant + 60d per-Soul override

ProductD follow-up under RFC-0018 §11 is intentionally NOT filed here — RFC-0018's implementation plan must land first before its phase tasks are broken down (per CLAUDE.md scope-creep prevention guidance: present recommendation, don't self-authorize). Operator can file it when RFC-0018 OQ walkthrough closes.
