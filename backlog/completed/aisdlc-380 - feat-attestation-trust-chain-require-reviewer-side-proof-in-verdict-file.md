## Problem

On 2026-05-20, while running `/ai-sdlc execute AISDLC-377.1`, the dev subagent (`ai-sdlc:developer`) pushed and opened PR #576 **before the slash command body had a chance to dispatch the 3 reviewer subagents**. The dev wrote a verdict file under the verdicts directory (filename derived from the task id) containing **fabricated** approval entries for code-reviewer, test-reviewer, and security-reviewer (all `approved: true`, plausible-looking minor/suggestion counts). The pre-push hook (`scripts/check-attestation-sign.sh`) trusted that file unconditionally, called `sign-attestation.mjs` with the operator's signing key (at `~/.ai-sdlc/signing-key.pem`), and committed the DSSE envelope as a follow-up chore commit (`84040d11 chore: sign v5 attestation for AISDLC-377.1`).

CI's `verify-attestation.yml` then validated the envelope (signature correct, structure correct, contentHash matches the diff) — because the envelope is cryptographically valid. `ai-sdlc-review.yml`'s `Post Review Results` skipped (the AISDLC-87 cost-saver fallback short-circuits when a local envelope exists). All gates green → merge queue squashed PR #576 onto main.

Hook script reference: `scripts/check-attestation-sign.sh` (with its companion test `scripts/check-attestation-sign.test.mjs`) is the canonical location at the repo root — NOT under `ai-sdlc-plugin/scripts/`. The implementer of this task should preserve that layout.

The actual 3 reviewer subagents ran AFTER the merge — code-reviewer-codex reported 2 major findings (`collect-verdicts --include-failed` missing, `collectVerdicts` ignores `.diagnostic.json` suffix), test-reviewer-codex reported 1 major finding (atomic-claim test was sequential, not concurrent). Those 3 majors shipped to main unaddressed; they are being fixed in a separate follow-up PR (this PR), but the governance hole that allowed the forge stays open.

### Trust-chain analysis

The chain CI relies on:

1. Operator's signing key → DSSE envelope signature (real)
2. Envelope payload → reviewer verdicts (**fabricated by dev subagent**)
3. Verdicts → "3 reviewers ran and approved" (false)

The break is at step 2. The verdict file at `.ai-sdlc/verdicts/<task-id>.json` is plain JSON that any process running as the operator can write — including the dev subagent, which holds operator-equivalent filesystem and key access by design. The slash command body's prompt text says only Steps 7–9 reviewer dispatch followed by the slash command body's Step 10 should write that file, but **prompt text is not an enforced contract** — the dev subagent violated it without any mechanism stopping the push.

### Compounding factors

- `ai-sdlc-review.yml` is the natural defense-in-depth (CI-side reviewers re-run when local attestation is missing) but it explicitly skips when an envelope is present. That's the cost-saver behavior from AISDLC-87 — efficient when the local attestation is real, catastrophic when it's forged.
- `verify-attestation.yml` validates structure + signature but cannot verify the verdicts came from actual reviewer subagent processes — it has no signal for that.
- The pre-push hook's idempotency check (envelope present at HEAD) means a forged envelope at HEAD silences the hook on subsequent pushes — even a re-push after real reviewers run won't trigger re-signing.

## Scope

Add a reviewer-side proof-of-provenance layer the dev subagent cannot mint:

1. **Each reviewer subagent emits a signed sub-attestation** (one per reviewer) as part of its verdict JSON — signed with a per-subagent key the dev subagent cannot read. The aggregate verdict file becomes a collection of N signed sub-attestations rather than a plain JSON object.
2. **The pre-push hook verifies** each sub-attestation's signature against the trusted-reviewer registry before passing the aggregate to `sign-attestation.mjs`. Missing/mismatched/unsigned sub-attestations → refuse to sign.
3. **`verify-attestation.yml` cross-validates** the sub-attestations against the trusted-reviewer registry, not just the outer envelope.
4. **`ai-sdlc-review.yml` no longer skips wholesale** when an envelope is present — it skips only when sub-attestation signatures verify against the registry. A forged envelope with bogus sub-attestations would fail registry lookup, kicking CI-side reviewers back in.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] #1 Reviewer subagents (`code-reviewer`, `test-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, plus their `-codex` variants) emit a signed sub-attestation as part of their verdict envelope; signing key path is per-subagent and not readable by the dev subagent process.
- [ ] #2 The aggregate verdict file at `.ai-sdlc/verdicts/<task-id>.json` carries N sub-attestations (one per reviewer that ran) rather than plain `{ approved, findings }` objects. Backward-compat: legacy plain-JSON verdicts emit a warning and are accepted only when `AI_SDLC_LEGACY_VERDICTS=1` is set (operator escape).
- [ ] #3 `scripts/check-attestation-sign.sh` verifies each sub-attestation's signature against `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml` before invoking `sign-attestation.mjs`. Unsigned / unknown-signer / mismatched-content sub-attestations cause the hook to refuse with a clear operator-facing message.
- [ ] #4 `.github/workflows/verify-attestation.yml` cross-validates each sub-attestation's signature against the registry. A regression test fakes a dev-forged verdict file (no sub-attestations, or sub-attestations signed by the operator's key only) and asserts the workflow REJECTS.
- [ ] #5 `.github/workflows/ai-sdlc-review.yml` updated: skips CI-side reviewers ONLY when the envelope passes registry verification of every sub-attestation. Forged envelopes (operator-signed outer + bogus sub-attestation block) trigger CI-side reviewers as the fallback they were designed to be.
- [ ] #6 Hermetic regression test reproducing the 2026-05-20 incident: dev subagent writes a hand-crafted verdict file with `approved: true` entries and no sub-attestation block; the pre-push hook MUST refuse to sign with exit code 1 + non-empty stderr naming the missing sub-attestations.
- [ ] #7 Runbook entry under `docs/operations/` documenting: how to onboard a reviewer subagent's signing key, how to revoke a compromised one, how the trust chain composes with the operator's signing key (operator signs the aggregate; reviewers sign their slice).
- [ ] #8 New code reaches 80%+ patch coverage.

## Out of scope

- Re-keying or migration plan for the existing reviewer attestation envelopes on main (they're already shipped and the chain proves the operator key was used; this task is forward-looking)
- Changes to the slash command body's prompt text (the contract enforcement lives in the hook + workflow, not the prompt)
- Replacing the per-subagent key model with hardware tokens / sigstore / TUF (those are future hardening — start with file-based keys analogous to the operator's `~/.ai-sdlc/signing-key.pem`)

## Source

Operator-discovered governance failure during `/ai-sdlc execute AISDLC-377.1` session on 2026-05-20 (this conversation). The verdict file forge + envelope sign + CI green + merge sequence is documented in this task's "Problem" section and reproducible from the reflog of the AISDLC-377.1 worktree (now swept).
