## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Phase 2.1 of RFC-0009. Admission composite recognizes `tessellation` and routes Sα + Eρ₄ resolution through soul scope. Depends on RFC-0014 dep-graph (already Implemented) for `resolveAffectedSouls(w)` computation.

## Scope (RFC-0009 §10 Phase 2, §6 admission composite extension)

- Admission composite (Sα + Eρ₄ resolution) recognizes `tessellation` field on the DID.
- Routes resolution through soul scope when `tessellation` is present.
- `resolveAffectedSouls(w)` computed from the RFC-0014 dependency graph (OQ-2 sub-decision).
- Substrate-only changes that touch no soul-importing module fall through to the `min`-over-all-souls degenerate case.
- Reference implementation produces before/after admit invocations demonstrating the Design pillar lift on soul-bounded work.

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Admission composite reads `tessellation` field from DID and routes through soul scope when present
- [ ] #2 `resolveAffectedSouls(w)` reads RFC-0014 dep-graph snapshot
- [ ] #3 Substrate-only changes (no soul-importing module touched) fall through to `min`-over-all-souls degenerate case per §6
- [ ] #4 Sα + Eρ₄ scores propagate per-soul correctly
- [ ] #5 Test fixtures cover: tessellated DID + soul-touching change; tessellated DID + substrate-only change; non-tessellated DID (legacy path)
- [ ] #6 Reference before/after admit invocations documented in `docs/`
