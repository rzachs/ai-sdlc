## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Phase 1 of RFC-0009 Implementation Sequencing (§10). Schema amendments + init scaffolding + fixtures. Foundation for all later RFC-0009 phases.

## Pre-work blocker

**Product Authority sign-off on RFC-0009 v3.4 is pending** (Alex authored v3.2; Engineering ✅ + Design ✅ have signed v3.4; Alex hasn't signed v3.4 explicitly). Implementation should not start until Alex signs OR the operator explicitly authorizes proceeding without product sign-off. Per AISDLC-296 (DoR upstream-OQ gate), DoR rejection on `lifecycle < Signed Off` is the long-term mechanical gate — until that ships, this is a process check.

## Scope (RFC-0009 §10 Phase 1, §5 schema)

- Add `triad`, `tessellation`, `parentTessellation` field definitions to `spec/schemas/design-intent-document.schema.json` per §5.
- Mark `triad` as required (OQ-1 resolution).
- Ship `init` scaffolding for the required-with-defaults pattern (operator-wears-all-three-pillars baseline; explicit-role override per §5.3).
- Existing fixtures gain auto-scaffolded `triad` blocks via `init` re-run.
- New fixtures with tessellation fields validate against the schema.
- Mixed-fixture compatibility test: Tessellated DID with Soul DIDs that omit optional fields validate.
- Reference implementation provides 4 production fixtures (1 Tessellated DID + 3 Soul DIDs) for the framework's test suite.

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 RFC-0009 v3.4 carries Product Authority sign-off OR operator authorizes proceeding without (recorded in task summary)
- [ ] #2 `design-intent-document.schema.json` has `triad`, `tessellation`, `parentTessellation` field definitions per §5
- [ ] #3 `triad` field marked required per OQ-1 resolution
- [ ] #4 `init` scaffolding ships for the required-with-defaults pattern
- [ ] #5 Existing fixtures auto-scaffolded with `triad` blocks via `init` re-run; backward-compat preserved
- [ ] #6 Mixed-fixture compatibility test passes (Tessellated DID + Soul DIDs omitting optional fields)
- [ ] #7 4 production fixtures shipped (1 Tessellated DID + 3 Soul DIDs)
- [ ] #8 Schema validation tests cover happy path + missing-triad + invalid-tessellation
