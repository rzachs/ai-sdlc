## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
## Problem
Shell scripts (orchestrator state-check, hook gates) live in the framework
repo's `scripts/` directory. Adopters need their own copies under
`<adopter-repo>/scripts/` so the plugin commands and pre-push hooks can invoke
them via stable relative paths.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 #1 `/ai-sdlc init` writes `scripts/check-orchestrator-state.sh`, `scripts/check-attestation-sign.sh`, `scripts/check-task-moved.sh`, `scripts/check-coverage.sh` (plus any other shell scripts the slash command body invokes) into the adopter repo
- [ ] #2 #2 Vendored scripts are operator-resolvable: same exit codes, same env-var skip flags (AI_SDLC_SKIP_*), same idempotency contracts as framework versions
- [ ] #3 #3 Scripts ship with `chmod +x` set so husky can invoke them without permission errors
- [ ] #4 #4 `/ai-sdlc init` is idempotent — re-running on existing adopter repo updates scripts to current plugin version, preserves any operator-local additions in scripts/ (warn on conflict, never overwrite without `--force`)
- [ ] #5 #5 Hermetic test: empty fixture project + `/ai-sdlc init` + assert each script exists, executable, prints expected version banner
- [ ] #6 #6 Operator runbook (`docs/operations/adopter-onboarding.md`) documents the upgrade flow when plugin version bumps the scripts
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- SECTION:ACCEPTANCE:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #7 #1 /ai-sdlc init writes all required scripts/ shell files into adopter repo
- [ ] #8 #2 Vendored scripts behaviorally match framework versions (exit codes, skip flags, idempotency)
- [ ] #9 #3 Scripts ship with chmod +x set
- [ ] #10 #4 Init idempotent + safe on re-run; warns on operator-edited conflicts
- [ ] #11 #5 Hermetic test: fixture project init + script resolution
- [ ] #12 #6 Adopter onboarding runbook documents upgrade flow
