## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
AISDLC-115.3 test reviewer follow-up (minor).

`pipeline-cli/src/dor/shadow-mode.test.ts` (around line 2114) asserts `r.disagreementRate >= 0` then filters out gate-4/6 'genuine improvement' disagreements before comparing against the 5% threshold.

The honest framing in the file header explains the trade-off, but the test would be slightly stronger if it also asserted:
- The count of EXPECTED genuine-improvement disagreements equals exactly 10 (5 gate-4 fixtures + 5 gate-6 fixtures), so a future fixture rename or skipped fixture surfaces immediately
- `r.total === fixtures.length`, so empty-corpus regressions surface

Trivial change; defense against silent corpus drift.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Test asserts the count of genuine-improvement disagreements is exactly 10 (5 gate-4 + 5 gate-6 fixtures)
- [ ] #2 Test asserts `r.total === fixtures.length` so an empty corpus or skipped fixtures fail loudly
- [ ] #3 Test header comment updated to reflect the new exact-count assertion
<!-- AC:END -->
