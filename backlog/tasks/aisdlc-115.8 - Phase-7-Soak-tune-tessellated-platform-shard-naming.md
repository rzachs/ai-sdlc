## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Soak + tune phase. Folds in Alex's Addition 2 (tessellated-platform shard naming). Per maintainer directive 2026-05-01, the exit criterion is corpus-driven (false-positive rate threshold), NOT calendar-driven. Whichever comes first — calendar duration is a side-effect, not a gate. Per RFC §12 Phase 7.

## Partial-ship status (2026-05-02)

This task is split into a code-deliverable slice (ACs #3, #4, #6 — shipped) and an operator-driven soak slice (ACs #1, #2, #5 — operator follow-up). The code slice ships in PR `ai-sdlc/aisdlc-115.8-soak-shard`; the soak slice runs the system in `warn-only` against the real issue stream and tunes Stage B from observed false-positives.

### Abstraction state — no upstream "Tessellated DID" code exists yet

RFC-0008 §4.2 + Addendum B describe a Design Intent Document with `soulPurpose`, `experientialTargets`, `brandIdentity`, etc. — none of that is implemented in `pipeline-cli/` or `orchestrator/` today. Rather than block on building a full DID loader, this slice ships a **minimal `ProjectShardManifest` scaffold** (`{ shards: string[]; manifestRef?: string }`) on `IssueInput`. When a future DID loader lands, it can project into this shape without breaking Gate 5's API. Documented inline at `pipeline-cli/src/dor/types.ts` and `pipeline-cli/src/dor/gates/gate-5-surface.ts`.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Run DoR in `warn-only` mode against real issue stream (no blocking); collect false-positive data to calibration log per Phase 5
- [ ] #2 Tune Stage B agent prompt + per-gate severity based on observed false-positives
- [x] #3 Tessellated-platform shard naming per Alex's Addition 2: when project's DID is a Tessellated DID with >1 shard, Gate 5 also requires shard identification; clarification message lists shard names
- [x] #4 Single-shard / non-tessellated platforms unaffected by the new check (regression test)
- [ ] #5 Phase 7 EXIT CRITERION (corpus-driven, NOT calendar-driven per maintainer directive 2026-05-01): false-positive rate < 10% per gate AND override-rate plateau in calibration log
- [x] #6 New code reaches 80%+ patch coverage
<!-- AC:END -->

## Operator follow-up (ACs #1, #2, #5)

These ACs are data-driven, NOT code-driven. They cannot be discharged by a developer agent because they depend on running the system + accumulating false-positive observations. After this PR merges:

1. **AC #1** — Operator runs the dogfood pipeline with `evaluationMode: warn-only` (already the default per `dor-config.ts`) against the real GitHub-issue + backlog-task stream and lets the calibration log accumulate (`$ARTIFACTS_DIR/_dor/calibration.jsonl`, AISDLC-115.6).
2. **AC #2** — Once calibration data exists, the operator inspects the FP buckets per gate and tunes either (a) the `refinement-reviewer.md` Stage B prompt or (b) per-gate `severity` overrides via `dor-config.yaml`. No new code changes anticipated for the framework itself.
3. **AC #5** — Operator reads the weekly digest (`cli-dor-digest`, AISDLC-115.6) and flips the gate when (per-gate FP rate < 10%) AND (override-rate plateau visible). The flip itself is AISDLC-115.9 (Phase 8: Enforce).
