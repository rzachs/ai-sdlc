/**
 * `ai-sdlc-pipeline execute <task-id>` — umbrella subcommand that composes
 * Steps 0-13 end-to-end (AISDLC-182).
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * Until this subcommand existed there was no way for a non-slash-command
 * caller (e.g. an AI assistant working alongside the operator in the main
 * Claude Code session, a cron job, or a webhook handler) to invoke the full
 * Step 0-13 pipeline in a single call WITHOUT either:
 *
 *   1. Manually composing the per-step subcommands AND remembering to write
 *      the verdict file at the right point so the pre-push hook auto-signs
 *      the DSSE envelope (the failure mode that triggered AISDLC-182 — ~10
 *      PRs shipped to main without reviewer verdicts because the assistant
 *      skipped Steps 7/8/10), OR
 *   2. Switching to the API-key-billed `pnpm --filter @ai-sdlc/dogfood watch`
 *      flow, which uses paid Anthropic API instead of the operator's
 *      subscription.
 *
 * This subcommand is a thin wrapper around the existing `executePipeline()`
 * library function (RFC-0012 §7.1) — it does NOT re-implement Step 0-13
 * logic. The wrapper's responsibilities are:
 *
 *   1. Resolve a `SubagentSpawner` from the `--spawner` flag.
 *   2. Call `executePipeline()` with that spawner + the operator's options.
 *   3. Hook into `onProgress` (per-iteration aggregated verdict callback)
 *      to write `<worktree>/.ai-sdlc/verdicts/<task-id-lower>.json` after
 *      every Step 8 aggregate so the husky pre-push hook
 *      (`scripts/check-attestation-sign.sh`) can auto-sign the DSSE envelope
 *      at Step 11 push time.
 *   4. Emit `[ai-sdlc-progress] execute: <stage>` lines so the dispatching
 *      session can surface progress to the operator.
 *
 * # Spawner routing (`--spawner`)
 *
 *   - `mock`       — `MockSpawner` with hard-coded approval fixtures.
 *                    For dry-run plumbing checks + integration tests only.
 *                    Default in v1 because the real spawners (`api-key`,
 *                    `claude`, `codex`) carry billing / cross-session
 *                    implications that need explicit operator opt-in.
 *                    `--run --spawner mock` refuses before filesystem mutation.
 *   - `api-key`    — `defaultSpawner()`'s SDK path (uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
 *                    Burns API credits per dispatch — same billing model as
 *                    `pnpm dogfood watch`. Documented for AI-assistant /
 *                    unattended use when subscription auth is unavailable.
 *   - `claude`     — `ShellClaudePSpawner` (AISDLC-349, default for the
 *                    autonomous orchestrator since AISDLC-352). Shells out to
 *                    the operator's installed `claude -p` for each dispatch.
 *                    Uses subscription auth (Agent SDK credit pool post-
 *                    2026-06-15). The recommended path for cron / daemon /
 *                    sidecar invocations.
 *   - `codex`      — `CodexHarnessAdapter` over the Codex `spawn_agent` host
 *                    tool (AISDLC-202.2, Phase 2). The CLI resolver constructs
 *                    the adapter with a subprocess bridge whose path is read
 *                    from `CODEX_SPAWN_AGENT_BIN` (the operator's wrapper
 *                    around Codex's `spawn_agent`). When that env var is
 *                    absent the resolver fails with a clear configuration
 *                    message rather than silently dispatching to nothing.
 *                    Programmatic callers can bypass the env var by
 *                    constructing `CodexHarnessAdapter` directly with a
 *                    custom `CodexSpawnAgentFn` injection.
 *                    Design map: `docs/operations/codex-execution-path.md`.
 *   - `copilot`    — `CopilotHarnessAdapter` over the Copilot `spawn_agent`
 *                    host tool (AISDLC-429.2, Phase 2). The CLI resolver
 *                    constructs the adapter with a subprocess bridge whose
 *                    path is read from `COPILOT_SPAWN_AGENT_BIN`. When
 *                    that env var is absent the resolver fails with a clear
 *                    configuration message before any pipeline mutation.
 *                    Programmatic callers can bypass the env var by
 *                    constructing `CopilotHarnessAdapter` directly with a
 *                    custom `CopilotSpawnAgentFn` injection.
 *
 * # Hard rules honored
 *
 * Same set the slash command body honors (RFC-0012 §3.1, AISDLC-182 AC #3):
 *
 *   1. Never `gh pr merge` — Step 11 only opens PRs.
 *   2. Never `git push --force` / `-f` — Step 11 aborts on non-fast-forward.
 *   3. Never close PRs / issues — no such code path exists.
 *   4. Never delete branches — no such code path exists.
 *   5. Never edit `.ai-sdlc/**` or `.github/workflows/**` — pre-tool-use
 *      hook blocks anyway; we only WRITE to `.ai-sdlc/verdicts/` (the
 *      designated verdict drop folder, not config/CI).
 *   6. Never write CI-skip magic tokens to commit messages — the chore
 *      commit body produced by Step 10 is sanitised by the existing
 *      `finalizeTask()` step.
 *
 * @module cli/execute
