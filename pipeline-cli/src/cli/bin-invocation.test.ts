/**
 * Regression test for AISDLC-156 — guard the bin invocation pattern used by
 * `.github/workflows/ai-sdlc-review.yml` and `.github/workflows/dor-ingress.yml`.
 *
 * History: pre-AISDLC-156 the workflow invoked the 3 cost-optimization CLIs
 * (`cli-classify-pr`, `cli-incremental-decide`, `cli-classify-budget`) via
 * `pnpm --filter @ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli exec cli-XXX`. That form silently
 * failed (`ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_EXEC_FIRST_FAIL`: `Command "cli-XXX" not
 * found`) on EVERY CI run because `pnpm exec` does NOT resolve a workspace
 * package's OWN bin entries — only its DEPENDENCIES' bins are symlinked
 * into `node_modules/.bin/`. The `|| echo <fallback-json>` safety net then
 * fired unconditionally, defeating the AISDLC-141/142/147/149/154 cost
 * optimizations entirely (every PR ran full-budget reviewers, blowing
 * through Anthropic credits, posting CHANGES_REQUESTED on credit
 * exhaustion).
 *
 * AISDLC-181 extension: the AISDLC-156 sweep covered the per-CLI cost-saver
 * bins but missed the umbrella `ai-sdlc-pipeline` binary, which `dor-ingress.yml`
 * was still invoking via `pnpm --filter ... --silent exec ai-sdlc-pipeline`
 * at four call sites. The `--silent` flag swallowed the `Command not found`
 * banner so the failure surfaced only as `exit 1` with empty stderr — the
 * worst possible failure mode for debuggability. This test now also covers
 * the umbrella bin.
 *
 * The fix: invoke the bin shim DIRECTLY via `node ./pipeline-cli/bin/<bin>.mjs`.
 * This test guards three properties:
 *   1. Each bin shim under `pipeline-cli/bin/*.mjs` (per-CLI + umbrella)
 *      exists, is executable as a node entrypoint, and exits 0 on `--help`.
 *      This proves the shim file is present, the compiled `dist/cli/...js`
 *      target it imports is present, and the yargs router accepts `--help`.
 *      A regression that breaks any of these (e.g. someone deletes the
 *      bin file, renames the dist target, or removes the `--help` alias)
 *      fails this test immediately.
 *   2. `pnpm --filter @ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli exec <bin> --help` still
 *      returns the broken `Command not found` error for both per-CLI and
 *      umbrella bins. This is the defense-in-depth against a future
 *      regression where someone reverts the workflows to the broken pattern
 *      under the assumption that `pnpm exec` should "just work". When pnpm
 *      finally fixes this (or we migrate to a different package manager),
 *      this test fails LOUDLY and forces the operator to re-evaluate
 *      whether the workflows can go back to the simpler pattern. Until
 *      then, fail loudly.
 *   3. No workflow file under `.github/workflows/` invokes any of the
 *      guarded bins via `pnpm ... exec <bin>` — the workflow files MUST
 *      use the direct `node pipeline-cli/bin/<bin>.mjs` form. This is
 *      the AISDLC-181 framework-coverage-gap fix: the original AISDLC-156
 *      test only proved the bins themselves work, not that the workflows
 *      use the right invocation form. A static scan closes that gap.
 *
 * All three properties exercise the REAL filesystem (no mocks) because the
 * bug we're guarding against is a real-filesystem-resolution bug —
 * mocking `child_process` would defeat the purpose.
