/**
 * RFC-0035 Decision projection — materialize the `Decision` view from the
 * append-only event log.
 *
 * The projection is a left fold over events sharing the same `decisionId`,
 * applied in append order. Phase 1 only emits `decision-opened` events, so
 * the projection is trivial; later phases extend `applyEvent` with deltas
 * for `operator-answered`, `superseded`, `routing-changed`, etc.
 *
 * Forward-compat: unknown event types are folded into the `decisionLog`
 * (so `cli-decisions show` still surfaces them) but produce no state
 * mutation. This lets a newer reader gracefully consume a log written by
 * a forward-incompatible writer.
