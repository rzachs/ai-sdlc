/**
 * Dispatch Board protocol types (RFC-0041 §4.4).
 *
 * The Dispatch Board is a filesystem-backed queue/inflight/done/failed
 * channel that decouples the Conductor and Workers across process
 * boundaries. The Conductor writes manifests; Workers claim them atomically,
 * execute, and emit verdicts. The Conductor's pickup loop reads verdicts
 * and triggers reviewer fan-out + push + auto-merge arming.
 *
 * Phase 1 (AISDLC-377.1) ships the protocol surface + the in-session-agent
 * Worker kind. Phase 2 (AISDLC-377.3) adds the claude-p-shell supervisor.
 *
 * Schemas:
 *   - spec/schemas/dispatch-manifest.v1.schema.json
 *   - spec/schemas/dispatch-verdict.v1.schema.json
 *   - spec/schemas/dispatch-config.v1.schema.json
