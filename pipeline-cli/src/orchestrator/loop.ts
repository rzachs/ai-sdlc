/**
 * Orchestrator polling loop — RFC-0015 Phase 1 (bare loop) + Phase 3
 * (pre-dispatch admission filters).
 *
 * Polling driver that reads the dispatch frontier (AISDLC-117 / RFC-0014),
 * runs the three §4.3 admission filters against each candidate, dispatches
 * the survivors via `executePipeline()` (RFC-0012 Tier 2), and escalates
 * unknown failures by tagging the relevant PR with `needs-human-attention`
 * (RFC-0015 §13 Q1 layer A + Q8 catch-all).
 *
 * Phase 1 shipped the bare loop. Phase 3 (this revision) adds:
 *   - Three pre-dispatch filters (dependency / DoR / external-deps) per
 *     RFC §4.3 — see `./filters/`.
 *   - Filter-trace logging on every evaluated candidate (Part B of the
 *     Phase 3 task spec).
 *   - `OrchestratorAwaitingExternal` + sibling `OrchestratorBlockedBy*`
 *     events on the tick result (Part C; Phase 4 / AISDLC-169.4 plumbs
 *     these into `events.jsonl`).
 *   - In-memory stuck-candidate counter (>5 ticks of the same skip → emit
 *     `OrchestratorStuckCandidate`). Persistence to
 *     `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/_orchestrator/state.json` is deferred to Phase 4
 *     alongside the events.jsonl writer; v1 resets the counter on restart.
 *   - Exponential-backoff sleep cadence (Q3 + Q5 resolution): base
 *     `tickIntervalSec` doubled per consecutive idle tick, capped at 5min,
 *     reset on dispatch OR new-task arrival. Idle reasons distinguished by
 *     event type (`OrchestratorIdleNoWork` vs `OrchestratorIdleAllFiltered`).
 *
 * Out of scope (deferred):
 *   - No catalogued failure-recovery handlers (Phase 2 / AISDLC-169.2 —
 *     in-flight on PR #224).
 *   - No events.jsonl writer or `cli-status --orchestrator` view
 *     (Phase 4 / AISDLC-169.4).
 *
 * What Phase 1 DOES guarantee:
 *   1. The loop honors `AI_SDLC_AUTONOMOUS_ORCHESTRATOR=experimental` — when
 *      the flag is unset the loop refuses to start and exits cleanly.
 *   2. Every dispatch flows through `executePipeline()` so it inherits the
 *      worktree allocation, sentinel write, finalize sequence (idempotent per
 *      RFC §13 Q2), and cleanup hook from RFC-0010 / RFC-0012 — no parallel
 *      worktree management code.
 *   3. Any exception escaping `executePipeline()` is captured, the failing
 *      task ID + error is recorded as an `UnknownFailureMode` escalation,
 *      and the PR (if one was opened before the throw) is tagged via the
 *      injected `EscalateFn`. The loop continues to the next tick — a
 *      single bad task never crashes the loop.
 *   4. SIGINT / SIGTERM drain the in-flight dispatch and exit cleanly.
 *
 * Adapters (`DispatchFn`, `FrontierFn`, `EscalateFn`) are dependency-injected
 * so unit tests can drive the loop without git/gh/spawner side effects.
 *
