/**
 * Append-only events writer for the autonomous-pipeline orchestrator
 * (RFC-0015 Phase 4 / AISDLC-169.4).
 *
 * `writeEvent()` appends one JSONL line to a date-rotated file at
 * `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/_orchestrator/events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`. The writer is
 * pure I/O — no formatting beyond `JSON.stringify(event) + '\n'` — and
 * creates parent directories on demand. Per RFC §7.3 the contract is
 * "the file exists, it's append-only, it's schema-stable"; the writer
 * never mutates existing lines + never reorders.
 *
 * Feature-flag gated: when `AI_SDLC_AUTONOMOUS_ORCHESTRATOR` is OFF the
 * writer is a no-op. This keeps the production surface dark for
 * operators who haven't opted into the orchestrator AND lets the loop
 * call `writeEvent()` unconditionally without leaking events when the
 * flag flips off mid-run.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: write failures are swallowed (one log line via
 * the optional logger) so a transient disk-full / EBADF never crashes
 * the orchestrator hot loop. The schema is published at
 * `spec/schemas/orchestrator-events.v1.schema.json` for downstream
 * consumers (cli-status --orchestrator, future web dashboard, Slack
 * push, etc.).
