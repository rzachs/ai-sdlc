/**
 * Pre-dispatch filter types (RFC-0015 Phase 3 / AISDLC-169.3).
 *
 * Each filter answers ONE question against ONE candidate task and returns a
 * uniform `{passed, reason?, detail?}` shape. The chain composes filters in
 * the order RFC §4.3 specifies and short-circuits on the first failure so
 * downstream filters don't waste work on a candidate that's already going to
 * be skipped.
 *
 * Filters are pure: they read the task graph + the calibration log + the
 * task's frontmatter and return a verdict. No git / gh / network calls — the
 * orchestrator loop owns side effects (the filter chain just observes).
 *
 * Trace + event emission are the loop's job; filters return data, the loop
 * formats it into log lines + event records.
