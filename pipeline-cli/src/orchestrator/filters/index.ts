/**
 * Public surface for the pre-dispatch filter chain (RFC-0015 Phase 3).

 * The orchestrator loop imports `runFilterChain` + `formatFilterTrace` from
 * here; everything else is internal. Each individual filter is also exported
 * for tests + future consumers (e.g. a `cli-orchestrator preview` subcommand)
 * that want to evaluate filters in isolation.
