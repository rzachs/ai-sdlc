## Changelog

All notable changes to the AI-SDLC Claude Code plugin (`ai-sdlc-plugin/`) are
documented in this file. The plugin version is tracked in `plugin.json`.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
with entries grouped under a release heading or `Unreleased` while in flight.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Pre-sign rebase + conditional re-review** (`agents/execute-orchestrator.md`
  Step 10.5; `scripts/sign-attestation.mjs --print-content-hash`): inserted a
  new step between Step 9 (review iteration loop) and Step 10 (sign attestation)
  that fetches `origin/main` (with a 30s timeout), skips when `git merge-base
  --is-ancestor` reports no-op, otherwise rebases. The post-rebase
  `contentHash` (AISDLC-94 dual-hash oracle) decides whether reviewers'
  approval still binds (same hash → reuse) or whether 3 reviewers must
  re-spawn for one round (different hash → re-review). Rebase conflicts abort
  with `outcome: aborted (rebase-conflict)`; rebase-loop (main moves 3 times
  during attempts) aborts with `outcome: aborted (rebase-loop)` — the
  orchestrator never auto-resolves. Re-review iterations share Step 9's cap
  (max 2 dev iterations); cap exceeded → ships as `[needs-human-attention]`.
  Step 3 (worktree setup) ALSO fetches latest main first so the developer +
  reviewers run against current state from the start. Together with
  AISDLC-101 (verifier-side per-file delta hashing) this closes the
  AISDLC-93 / PR #102 attestation-invalidation gap as a defense-in-depth
  pair: producer-side Step 10.5 minimises *fresh* invalidation by signing
  the latest state; verifier-side AISDLC-101 accepts envelopes whose
  per-file blob SHA matches when sibling PRs merge between our push and our
  merge. The new `--print-content-hash` flag on `sign-attestation.mjs` is a
  read-only oracle used by Step 10.5 to compare pre/post rebase content
  without requiring a signing key. Tier 2 implementation (`pipeline-cli/src/steps/`)
  is deferred to AISDLC-100.5 (RFC-0012 Phase 5) since `pipeline-cli/`
  doesn't exist yet (RFC-0012 Phase 1 = AISDLC-100.1). Test coverage:
  `commands/execute.test.mjs` adds 9 new assertions on the orchestrator
  body for Step 10.5 prose markers and Step 3 fresh-base behaviour.
  (AISDLC-102)
- **RFC docs-drift CI gate** (`scripts/check-rfc-docs.mjs` +
  `scripts/check-rfc-docs.test.mjs` + `pnpm rfc:check` / `pnpm rfc:test`):
  enforces the `requiresDocs` convention defined in AISDLC-69.2. The script
  walks `spec/rfcs/RFC-*.md` (skipping the template), parses YAML
  frontmatter, and for every sign-off-locked RFC (`status: Approved`,
  `Implemented`, or `Final`) verifies that each surface listed in
  `requiresDocs` has at least one .md file under the corresponding
  `docs/<subdir>/` (per the schema enum: tutorial→tutorials,
  operator-runbook→operations, api-reference→api-reference,
  getting-started→getting-started, example→examples) that references the
  RFC by its `id`. RFCs flagged `deferredDocs: true` short-circuit with a
  warning that announces remaining days until the deadline (or `OVERDUE`).
  Pre-sign-off statuses (`Draft`, `Under Review`, `Rejected`, `Withdrawn`)
  are skipped — the operator process documented in `spec/rfcs/README.md`
  says docs land before requesting `Approved`, so we don't gate authoring.
  Wired into the root `pnpm test` chain so the check runs on every local
  test invocation. Operator follow-up: add `pnpm rfc:check` as an explicit
  step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (workflow files are blocked from the
  developer subagent, so this CHANGELOG entry is the handoff). Regression
  coverage: 46 node:test cases covering frontmatter parsing edge cases
  (CRLF, comments, malformed fences, inline empty list, block list,
  booleans), validation outcomes (Approved/Implemented/Final enforced;
  Draft/Under Review/Rejected/Withdrawn skipped; deferred warned;
  malformed rejected), recursive doc lookup, template skip, and CLI exit
  codes. (AISDLC-69.3)
- **CI-skip marker hygiene** (AISDLC-88) — three-layer prevention for the five
  GitHub Actions magic tokens (`(skip ci marker)`, `(ci skip marker)`, `(no ci marker)`,
  `(skip actions marker)`, `(actions skip marker)` — paren-quoted here to avoid
  triggering the parser this CHANGELOG entry documents) leaking into commit
  messages and silently disabling workflows.
  1. New `scripts/check-skip-ci-marker.sh` (`.husky/pre-push` wiring is an
     operator follow-up): scans every commit being pushed for the literal
     bracketed substrings (case-insensitive), prints a clear remediation
     message, and exits 1. Override via `AI_SDLC_SKIP_MARKER_GATE=1 git push`.
     Bot-author exemption: a commit authored by `ai-sdlc-ci-attestor[bot]`
     (production identity per `.github/workflows/ai-sdlc-review.yml`; legacy
     `github-actions[bot]` retained as a fallback in the script) AND subjected
     `chore(ci): sign review attestation*` passes (the documented AISDLC-87
     chore commit).
  2. New Hard Rule in `ai-sdlc-plugin/agents/developer.md` (Hard Rule 7) and
     `ai-sdlc-plugin/commands/execute.md` (post-AISDLC-98 the orchestrator
     subagent file is gone; the slash command body now hosts the rule). The
     agents must use the **paren-quoted form** when discussing these tokens
     in commit bodies. Backtick-wrapping does NOT defeat GitHub's
     literal-substring parser — only the bracket-free form is safe.
  3. The slash command body's Step 10 chore-commit body is now sed-sanitised
     before `git commit -m` as defense-in-depth (so even a leaked token in
     interpolated text gets rewritten before it can land).
- **CI-side attestor** (`scripts/ci-sign-attestation.mjs` +
  `.github/workflows/ai-sdlc-review.yml` Post Review Results step): when CI's
  three reviewer agents (testing/critic/security) all approve a PR AND the
  PR has no valid local attestation, CI signs a DSSE envelope with a
  `ci-attestor` key from GitHub Secrets and pushes it back to the PR branch
  with `[skip ci]`. The verifier (AISDLC-84/85) accepts CI-signed envelopes
  identically to maintainer-signed ones — same DSSE format, same predicate.
  Unblocks remote-agent `/ai-sdlc execute` runs (AISDLC-78/79/80/85 root
  cause was no signing key in the remote sandbox) and gives external
  contributors a zero-key path to a valid attestation. The CI signing step
  delegates the "should I sign?" decision to the existing verifier
  (`--skip-if-valid`), so it never redundantly signs over a valid local
  attestation but DOES sign additively alongside an invalid one (the
  multi-envelope scan picks the valid one). Step is gated to same-repo PRs
  via `head.repo.full_name == github.repository` — fork PRs cannot push to
  their head ref via GITHUB_TOKEN, so they get the existing friendly
  fallback comment instead. Bootstrap (one-time, maintainer-only) is
  documented in `CLAUDE.md` → "Bootstrap CI-side attestor": generate
  keypair, add private key as GH Secret `AI_SDLC_CI_ATTESTOR_PRIVATE_KEY`,
  uncomment + fill the placeholder in `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml`,
  open onboarding PR. Until that PR merges, `verify-attestation.yml`
  rejects CI-signed envelopes with `signature did not match any trusted
  reviewer pubkey` — the SAFE default (CI signing is additive, never
  weakens the trust model). Regression coverage:
  `scripts/ci-sign-attestation.test.mjs` exercises the three core shapes
  (no-local-attestation → CI signs → verifier valid; valid-local → CI
  no-ops; invalid-local → CI signs additively → verifier picks valid one)
  end-to-end against the real verifier. (AISDLC-87)

### Documentation

- **RFC-0006 retroactive user docs** (`docs/tutorials/design-system-getting-started.md`,
  `docs/operations/design-system-operator-runbook.md`,
  `docs/api-reference/design-system.md`): authored the three doc surfaces
  declared in RFC-0006's `requiresDocs` frontmatter. The tutorial (~1.3k
  words, three worked examples) walks a frontend team through declaring a
  `DesignSystemBinding`, wiring three quality gates, and operating the
  design-token-cascade / compose-or-justify / token-deletion-blocked flows
  end to end. The operator runbook (~1.2k words) covers the daily / weekly /
  monthly cadence for the design system maintainer + pipeline operator
  (rotating MCP bearer tokens, approving token migrations, refreshing
  baselines, tuning `cascadeThreshold` and review SLA) plus an
  RFC-0006-specific event triage table. The api-reference doc covers the
  three RFC-0006 adapter interfaces (`DesignTokenProvider`,
  `ComponentCatalog`, `VisualRegressionRunner`) and their project-owned
  reference implementations (`tokens-studio`, `figma-variables`,
  `storybook-mcp`, `playwright-visual`). RFC-0006 frontmatter
  `deferredDocs: true` removed (no longer applicable); `updated: 2026-04-30`
  bumped. Closes the canonical "missing docs" example that motivated
  AISDLC-69. (AISDLC-69.4)

- **RFC `requiresDocs` frontmatter convention** (`spec/rfcs/RFC-0001-template.md`,
  `spec/rfcs/README.md`, `spec/schemas/rfc.schema.json`): every RFC now
  carries a YAML frontmatter block with `id` / `title` / `status` / `author` /
  `created` / `updated` / `requiresDocs` (and optional `deferredDocs` +
  `deferredDocsDeadline`). The `requiresDocs` field is a closed enum
  (`tutorial`, `operator-runbook`, `api-reference`, `getting-started`,
  `example`) that declares which user-facing doc surfaces the RFC requires
  — the docs-drift CI gate (AISDLC-69.3) will enforce that each declared
  surface has at least one doc file referencing the RFC by ID. RFCs 0002,
  0003 (both 0003a and 0003b), 0004, 0005, 0006, 0008, and 0010 migrated
  from markdown-bold-style status (`**Status:** Draft`) to YAML; the
  bold-status block is preserved in the body for human readability but
  the frontmatter is the source of truth for tooling. The README RFC index
  table is refreshed to reflect actual statuses (RFC-0006 / RFC-0008 are
  `Final`, not `Draft`) and a new `requiresDocs` column. The stale
  RFC-0007 / RFC-0009 rows are documented as reserved/withdrawn slots.
  RFC-0006 declares `deferredDocs: true` with a `2026-07-31` deadline —
  AISDLC-69.4 tracks the retroactive doc authoring. (AISDLC-69.2)

- **Remote-agent usage policy** (`CLAUDE.md`): documented that Anthropic CCR
  remote agents (scheduled via the bundled `/schedule` skill,
  `Path: bundled:schedule`) are read-only by design. Empirical 4-for-4
  failure rate of `/ai-sdlc execute` over `/schedule` (AISDLC-78, -79, -80,
  -85) confirmed the structural blockers: no signing key in the remote
  sandbox, plugin not auto-installed, subagents not registered, no local
  worktree. The new `Remote agents (/schedule) — read-only by design`
  section in `CLAUDE.md` lists acceptable patterns (PR status surveys,
  backlog state reports, cron-triggered metric digests, Slack workflows,
  CI run surveys) and explicitly-prohibited patterns
  (`/ai-sdlc execute`, signing-key-dependent flows, plugin-subagent
  flows, worktree flows, cross-repo write flows). Notes AISDLC-87
  (CI-side attestor) as the planned fix that will eventually unblock
  remote-agent `/ai-sdlc execute`. Since the `/schedule` skill is
  system-bundled (not in this repo), the callout lives in `CLAUDE.md`
  per AISDLC-86 AC #4. (AISDLC-86)

### Changed

- **`/ai-sdlc execute`, `/ai-sdlc status`, `/ai-sdlc triage`**: rewired all
  call sites that previously used `mcp__backlog__task_edit` and
  `mcp__backlog__task_complete` to the plugin's drop-in replacements
  `mcp__ai-sdlc-plugin__task_edit` / `mcp__ai-sdlc-plugin__task_complete`
  (shipped in AISDLC-73). The new tools preserve unknown frontmatter keys
  verbatim — most importantly `permittedExternalPaths`, which the upstream
  tools silently strip on every status flip, breaking cross-repo writes for
  any task that needs them. `mcp__backlog__task_view` (read-only) continues
  to use upstream. (AISDLC-83)
- `ai-sdlc-plugin/commands/execute.md` `allowed-tools` frontmatter updated
  accordingly: removed upstream `mcp__backlog__task_edit` /
  `mcp__backlog__task_complete`, added the plugin equivalents.

### Notes

- No MCP server schema changes were required — the AISDLC-73 tool schemas
  (`status`, `acceptanceCriteriaCheck`, `finalSummary`, `updatedDate` for
  `task_edit`; `id`, `finalSummary`, `updatedDate` for `task_complete`)
  already cover every field `/ai-sdlc execute` needs. No bundle rebuild
  was needed for AISDLC-83.
- AC #4 of AISDLC-83 (end-to-end dogfood verification with a task carrying
  `permittedExternalPaths`) is intentionally deferred to a manual run by
  the human operator after this PR merges.
