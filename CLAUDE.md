# AI-SDLC Project Instructions

## Git Flow

- **Always rebase** feature branches onto main. Never merge main into a feature branch.
- When updating a feature branch with latest main: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`
- After rebase: `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>`
- Never use `gh api pulls/N/update-branch` with merge method.
- Keep commit history linear — no merge commits on feature branches.

### Automated rebase via `/ai-sdlc rebase <pr>` (AISDLC-105)

Manual rebase + conflict resolution loops were eating significant orchestrator
time. The `/ai-sdlc rebase <pr-number>` slash command (backed by the
`rebase-resolver` plugin subagent) automates the mechanical 80% of the work
and escalates the architectural 20%.

What it handles automatically:

1. **CHANGELOG `Unreleased > Added` overlaps** → keeps both bullets
2. **Test additions to the same `describe(...)`** → keeps both `it()` cases
3. **Non-overlapping code additions** → keeps both unless a shared identifier
   suggests a logical conflict
4. **Prettier drift after manual edit** → runs `pnpm exec prettier --write`
   on every resolved file before `git rebase --continue` (the root cause of
   PR #115's iter-4 CI failure)
5. **Force-push hygiene** → uses `--force-with-lease`, refuses on `main`/`master`

What it escalates back:

1. **Modify-vs-delete conflicts** — needs a hand-port to a new architectural
   home, with a best-guess location in the escalation reason
2. **Semantic conflicts on overlapping lines** — both branches modified the
   same lines with different intent
3. **Verification failures** (`pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm lint && pnpm
   format:check`) after resolution — does NOT push
4. **Iteration cap exceeded** (3 rebase attempts couldn't converge because
   main keeps moving)

Re-attestation: only re-signs the DSSE envelope when `contentHash` actually
changed (uses `sign-attestation.mjs --print-content-hash` as the AISDLC-94/101
oracle). When the rebase didn't move any blob SHA at HEAD, the existing
attestation still verifies and is reused.

When to invoke manually:

- A PR's `verify-attestation.yml` reports `invalid (diff drift)` because a
  sibling PR merged into the same files
- A PR is "Update branch" yellow in the GitHub UI but you want a linear
  history (CLAUDE.md "Always rebase" rule, not the merge-commit alternative)
- A PR has been sitting idle while siblings merged and you want to avoid
  the manual rebase loop proactively

Out of scope:

- Does NOT merge PRs (only humans merge)
- Does NOT push with plain `--force` / `-f` (only `--force-with-lease`)
- Does NOT push to `main`/`master` (refuses early)
- Does NOT auto-resolve modify-vs-delete or semantic conflicts (escalates)
- Does NOT re-sign the attestation when the contentHash is unchanged

### CI marker hygiene (AISDLC-88)

GitHub Actions silently skips ALL workflows for a push when ANY commit body contains `[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `[no ci]`, `[skip actions]`, or `[actions skip]` — substring match, no warning. To discuss these tokens in commit messages without triggering the skip, use the paren-quoted form: `(skip ci marker)` instead of `[skip ci]`. Backtick-wrapping does NOT defeat the parser. The `scripts/check-skip-ci-marker.sh` pre-push gate enforces this.

## Branch Naming

- Feature branches: `feat/<description>` or `ai-sdlc/issue-<number>`
- Fix branches: `fix/<description>`

## Commits

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `style:`
- Include `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>` on all commits

## PRs

- **Never merge PRs** — only humans merge.
- **Never close issues or PRs.**
- **Never force push to main/master.**
- Dismiss stale reviews with a documented reason when they are false positives (truncated JSON, API errors).

## Testing

- Run `pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm lint && pnpm format:check` before pushing.
- **Canonical verification gate**: `.husky/pre-push` runs `scripts/check-coverage.sh`, which executes `pnpm -r test:coverage` workspace-wide and enforces the 80% codecov patch threshold. The pre-push hook is the authoritative boundary — fail-fast locally by running the full check chain above before `git push` so the gate is a no-op rather than a surprise. Skip with `AI_SDLC_SKIP_COVERAGE_GATE=1 git push` only when truly necessary. (AISDLC-108 deleted the per-turn `quality-gate-stop` Claude hook that previously duplicated this gate at the wrong layer — verification belongs on the git lifecycle, not every conversational turn. AISDLC-120 finished the cleanup chain by removing the agent-type Haiku governance Stop hook from `ai-sdlc-plugin/plugin.json`, which had been running the same per-turn verification with an LLM instead of a shell script. No Stop hooks remain that duplicate the husky pre-push verification.)
- Hook scripts (`.js` in `ai-sdlc-plugin/hooks/`) are tested via Node built-in test runner (`.test.mjs`), not Vitest.
- MCP server and orchestrator use Vitest.

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode, ESM modules.
- Prettier for formatting, ESLint for linting.
- No unnecessary abstractions — three similar lines are better than a premature abstraction.

## Review attestations

`/ai-sdlc execute` runs three reviewer subagents (code/test/security) locally before pushing, then signs a DSSE attestation that CI verifies and trusts — skipping its own duplicate review run. Half of every clean run used to be duplicate review work; the attestation collapses it (AISDLC-74).

### Bootstrap (one time per machine)

1. `/ai-sdlc init-signing-key` — generates `~/.ai-sdlc/signing-key.pem` (ed25519, mode 0600) and prints a YAML block.
2. Open a PR adding that YAML block to `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml`. A maintainer reviews + merges (just like any policy change).
3. After merge, `/ai-sdlc execute` will produce attestations CI accepts.

If `/ai-sdlc execute` errors with `signing-key not found`, run step 1 + open the onboarding PR first. Until the PR merges, attestations still get signed but CI marks them invalid (`signature did not match any trusted reviewer pubkey`) and runs its own review.

### File convention

- `~/.ai-sdlc/signing-key.pem` — private key (mode 0600, never committed, never leaves your machine)
- `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml` — pubkey allowlist (committed, reviewed)
- `.ai-sdlc/attestations/<commit-sha>.dsse.json` — per-commit signed envelopes (committed, ~1-2KB each, audit trail)
- `.ai-sdlc/schemas/attestation.v3.schema.json` — JSON schema (current allowlist: `['v3']` — narrowed from `['v1']` in AISDLC-103)

### CI behavior

- `verify-attestation.yml` runs on `pull_request`. It scans every `.ai-sdlc/attestations/*.dsse.json` on the PR branch and matches by recomputing the predicate's content bindings (`contentHashV3`, policy hash, agent file hashes, plugin version, schema version) against current PR state — so the verifier is rebase-stable (AISDLC-84) and sibling-overlap-tolerant (AISDLC-101 + AISDLC-102 + AISDLC-103). It sets the `ai-sdlc/attestation` commit status to `valid` or `invalid (<reason>)`.
- `ai-sdlc-review.yml` Post Review Results checks that status. When `valid`, it short-circuits cleanly with a notice. Otherwise, it runs the duplicate review normally.
- Force-pushes to PRs with valid attestations now auto-recover the bot approval (AISDLC-93); no manual `gh pr review --approve` needed. The skip-when-attestation-valid step posts a fresh `gh pr review --approve` so branch protection's `dismiss_stale_reviews: true` rule (which dismisses the prior approval on every push) doesn't strand auto-merge.
- When the attestation is missing or invalid, `verify-attestation.yml` ALSO posts a friendly educational PR comment (idempotent — checked via `<!-- ai-sdlc:attestation-fallback-comment -->` marker before posting again). The comment explains the bootstrap flow and the most common failure causes (force-push diff change, policy edit, missing trusted-reviewers entry).

### What CI rejects (intentional)

- Force-push that changes reviewed content after signing → `contentHashV3 mismatch`
- Legacy `diffHash`-only (v1, pre-AISDLC-94) envelope on a PR after AISDLC-103 → `schemaVersion 'v1' not in allowlist [v3]`
- Legacy `contentHash`-only (v2, AISDLC-94 dual-hash window) envelope on a PR after AISDLC-103 → `schemaVersion 'v1' not in allowlist [v3]` (the AISDLC-94 + AISDLC-101 windows kept all envelopes as `schemaVersion: 'v1'`; only post-AISDLC-103 envelopes carry `'v3'`)
- v3-shaped envelope smuggling a `diffHash` or `contentHash` field → `schema validation failed: diffHash is forbidden in v3 envelopes` / `... contentHash is forbidden in v3 envelopes`
- Edit to `.ai-sdlc/review-policy.md` after signing → `policyHash mismatch`
- Edit to `ai-sdlc-plugin/agents/*.md` after signing → `agentFileHashes[<name>] mismatch`
- `schemaVersion` outside the current allowlist → `schemaVersion 'vN' not in allowlist [v3]`
- `pluginVersion` drift between the attestation and `ai-sdlc-plugin/plugin.json` → `pluginVersion mismatch`
- Signature from a private key whose pubkey isn't in `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml` → `signature did not match any trusted reviewer pubkey`
- Copy-pasted attestation from another PR with different reviewed content → `contentHashV3 mismatch`

All rejections are by design (threat model). Re-run `/ai-sdlc execute` against the current head to produce a fresh v3 attestation.

### What CI accepts (intentional, post-AISDLC-103)

- Rebase, amend, or force-push that preserves each changed file's `(base_blob_sha → head_blob_sha)` transition → still valid. The single content binding is `contentHashV3 = sha256({path, fileDeltaHash} per changed file, sorted)`, where `fileDeltaHash[path] = sha256(<base_blob_sha> + ' -> ' + <head_blob_sha>)` and the base blob SHA is read at `git merge-base(<baseRef>, <headRef>)`. v3 commits to the per-file (base, head) blob-pair transition (= "we moved file F from blob A to blob B"), so a force-push that doesn't change the reviewed delta — for example, a chore commit on top of the dev commit, or an interactive rebase that reorders commits without changing the post-apply tree — is still valid. A genuine conflict-resolution content change still flips the head blob SHA → fileDeltaHash flips → reject (threat model preserved).
- History (the v1 → v2 → v3 migration). AISDLC-74/-84 shipped `diffHash` (sha256 of literal `git diff` text), which broke on every rebase because `@@` hunk headers shift even when post-apply content doesn't. AISDLC-94 added a verifier-side `contentHash` dual-hash leg (post-apply blob SHA per file), which was rebase-tolerant for the no-overlap case but broke under sibling overlap (the rebased file's head blob SHA contained the sibling's contributions). AISDLC-101 added the per-file (base, head) `contentHashV3` triple-hash leg. AISDLC-103 (this Phase 3) closes the migration: the `schemaVersion` allowlist narrows to `['v3']`, the legacy `diffHash` + `contentHash` fields are dropped from fresh predicates, and the verifier accepts ONLY the `contentHashV3` leg.
- Sibling-PR overlapping-files case (AISDLC-93 / PR #102 root case) is now handled by two paired defenses: (1) `/ai-sdlc execute` Step 10.5 (AISDLC-102) rebases onto latest `origin/main` BEFORE signing and re-spawns 3 reviewers when `contentHashV3` changed mid-run, so the producer signs the latest content; and (2) AISDLC-101 per-file delta hashing in the verifier accepts the residual cases without forcing re-sign. Together they close the AISDLC-93 limitation as a defense-in-depth pair.
- `pipelineVersion` drift between the attestation and `pipeline-cli/package.json` → still valid (AISDLC-100.6 / RFC-0012 Phase 6). Forensic / audit purpose only — the verifier reads `predicate.pipelineVersion` and emits a single info-level log line (`[ai-sdlc/attestation] pipelineVersion: <semver>` or `[ai-sdlc/attestation] pipelineVersion: <missing> (legacy envelope)`) so an operator scanning CI logs can correlate envelopes with the pipeline-cli version that signed them, but no enforcement happens at the verifier layer. This is the equivalent of `pluginVersion`'s field but for the `@ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli` workspace package, with the deliberate trade-off that we DON'T fail builds on pipeline-cli bumps (the package is internal to the dogfood pipeline, not load-bearing for the attestation threat model). The schema marks the field optional so envelopes signed before pipeline-cli existed continue to verify.

## CI-side attestor (AISDLC-87)

`/ai-sdlc execute` requires a local signing key — which fork PRs, remote-agent runs, and external contributors don't have. The CI-side attestor closes that gap: when CI's three reviewer agents (testing/critic/security) all approve a PR and no valid local attestation exists, `.github/workflows/ai-sdlc-review.yml` runs `scripts/ci-sign-attestation.mjs`, signs a DSSE envelope with the `ci-attestor` key from GitHub Secrets, and pushes it back to the PR branch. The verifier (AISDLC-84/85) accepts CI-signed envelopes identically to maintainer-signed ones — same DSSE format, same predicate, same threat model.

### Bootstrap CI-side attestor (one-time, maintainer-only)

This is a one-time setup the repo maintainer does ONCE per repo. After this, every PR that lacks a local attestation but has 3 approving CI reviews automatically gets a CI-signed envelope.

1. **Generate the keypair locally** (do NOT commit the private key):

   ```bash
   node -e '
     const { generateKeyPairSync } = require("node:crypto");
     const { privateKey, publicKey } = generateKeyPairSync("ed25519");
     const priv = privateKey.export({ format: "pem", type: "pkcs8" }).toString();
     const pub  = publicKey.export({ format: "pem", type: "spki" }).toString();
     require("node:fs").writeFileSync("/tmp/ci-attestor.priv.pem", priv);
     require("node:fs").writeFileSync("/tmp/ci-attestor.pub.pem",  pub);
     console.log("PRIVATE KEY: /tmp/ci-attestor.priv.pem (add to GH Secret AI_SDLC_CI_ATTESTOR_PRIVATE_KEY)");
     console.log("PUBLIC KEY (paste under ci-attestor in trusted-reviewers.yaml):");
     console.log(pub);
   '
   ```

2. **Add the private key as a GitHub Secret** named `AI_SDLC_CI_ATTESTOR_PRIVATE_KEY`:

   ```bash
   gh secret set AI_SDLC_CI_ATTESTOR_PRIVATE_KEY < /tmp/ci-attestor.priv.pem
   rm /tmp/ci-attestor.priv.pem  # only the GH Secret should hold it now
   ```

3. **Open an onboarding PR** that uncomments + fills in the `ci-attestor` placeholder block in `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml` with the public key from step 1. Example final block:

   ```yaml
     - identity: 'ci-attestor'
       machine: 'github-actions'
       addedAt: "<today's date>"
       addedBy: '<your GitHub handle>'
       pubkey: |
         -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
         <pubkey-pem-here>
         -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
   ```

   Maintainer reviews + merges this PR like any other policy change.

4. **Verify it works** by opening any PR with no local attestation. After CI's 3 reviewer agents all approve, the report job's "CI-side attestor" step signs an envelope and pushes a `chore(ci): sign review attestation [skip ci]` commit to the PR branch. The same step then posts the `ai-sdlc/attestation` commit status (`success`) DIRECTLY against the chore-commit SHA — `[skip ci]` prevents `verify-attestation.yml` from re-running on the chore commit, so we set the status ourselves (the CI-sign step just signed the envelope against current PR state, so the verifier would also report `valid` if it ran). The PR's required-checks then resolve cleanly without a second review pass.

### CI-attestor security model

- The CI-attestor key has the SAME trust as a maintainer key. Anyone who gets read access to `AI_SDLC_CI_ATTESTOR_PRIVATE_KEY` can sign valid attestations for any PR. Treat it like a maintainer credential: rotate on any suspected leak, and only grant `secrets:read` to workflows that need it.
- The CI-side attestor only signs after `analyze` (the sandboxed reviewer job) returns 3 approvals. It refuses to sign on `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. Even if the LLM were compromised, the verdict gate runs in the report job which has no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` access — it only reads structured JSON.
- The CI signing step is gated to same-repo PRs (`head.repo.full_name == github.repository`). Fork PRs cannot trigger CI signing because GITHUB_TOKEN can't push to a fork's head ref. Fork contributors get the friendly fallback comment from `verify-attestation.yml` and a maintainer can either approve manually or push the fork to a same-repo branch first.
- The chore commit uses `[skip ci]` to avoid loops — without it, the new commit would re-trigger `ai-sdlc-review.yml` which would re-run the reviewers, re-approve, re-sign, ad infinitum. Because `[skip ci]` ALSO suppresses `verify-attestation.yml` for the chore SHA, the CI-sign step posts the `ai-sdlc/attestation=success` commit status directly against the chore SHA after push (it just signed the envelope against current PR state, so the verifier would report the same).
- Rebase / chore-commit allowlist still applies (AISDLC-85). The CI attestor signs against the actual PR head SHA, so the envelope's subject + diff bind to the dev's commits — the chore-commit-on-top is the CI's own attestation chore commit, which falls under the existing `.ai-sdlc/attestations/<sha>.dsse.json` allowlist pattern.

### Operator workflow — external contributor PR (zero-key contributor)

1. External contributor opens a PR from their fork (or pushes to a same-repo branch). They have no signing key.
2. `verify-attestation.yml` reports `invalid (missing)` and posts the friendly fallback comment.
3. `ai-sdlc-review.yml`'s analyze job runs the 3 reviewer agents. They all approve.
4. `ai-sdlc-review.yml`'s report job's "CI-side attestor" step signs an envelope and pushes it to the PR branch.
   - Same-repo branch: succeeds, branch gets the chore commit, and the same step posts `ai-sdlc/attestation=success` directly against the chore-commit SHA (the `[skip ci]` tag would otherwise prevent `verify-attestation.yml` from running on that SHA).
   - Fork PR: skipped (token can't push). Maintainer either approves manually OR pulls the fork into a same-repo branch.
5. Maintainer (CODEOWNERS) reviews + approves the PR.
6. Merge queue picks it up + merges. No local-key requirement for the contributor.

## Remote agents (`/schedule`) — read-only by design

Anthropic CCR remote-agent runs (scheduled via the bundled `/schedule` skill, `Path: bundled:schedule`) execute on Anthropic infrastructure with a fresh, ephemeral filesystem and **no access to the operator's machine**. They MUST be treated as read-only.

**Empirical justification.** Four consecutive `/ai-sdlc execute` runs scheduled via `/schedule` failed identically (overnight: AISDLC-78 / -79 / -80; morning: AISDLC-85). Root cause is structural, not flaky: the remote sandbox has no signing key, doesn't auto-install the `ai-sdlc-plugin/`, and can't register the plugin's subagents — so Step 1 (worktree bootstrap) and Steps 5-10 (developer + reviewers + DSSE attestation) of the execute pipeline cannot run. The medium-term fix is **AISDLC-87 (CI-side attestor)**, which moves attestation signing into a trusted CI workflow and unblocks remote-agent `/ai-sdlc execute` runs. Until AISDLC-87 ships, the policy below is hard.

### Acceptable remote-agent task patterns (read-only)

- **PR status surveys** — `gh pr list`, `gh pr view`, summarising open reviews, flagging stale PRs.
- **Backlog state reports** — `mcp__backlog__task_list`, surfacing `In Progress` / blocked / overdue tasks.
- **Cron-triggered metric digests** — review-throughput counts, attestation valid/invalid ratios, dogfood-loop health.
- **Slack workflows** — morning check-ins, end-of-day summaries, on-call digests posted to a visibility channel.
- **CI / workflow status surveys** — `gh run list`, recent failures, flake detection across the last N runs.

All of the above only need `gh` / MCP read tools and the network — no signing key, no plugin, no worktree.

### Explicitly prohibited remote-agent patterns

- **`/ai-sdlc execute <task-id>`** — will fail at Step 1 (no plugin loaded) or Step 9 (no signing key).
- **Any signing-key-dependent flow** — `/ai-sdlc init-signing-key`, signing fresh DSSE attestations, anything that touches `~/.ai-sdlc/signing-key.pem`.
- **Any plugin-subagent-dependent flow** — `developer`, `code-reviewer`, `test-reviewer`, `security-reviewer` subagents are not registered in the remote sandbox.
- **Any flow that opens a worktree** — `/ai-sdlc execute`, `/ai-sdlc cleanup`, anything touching `.worktrees/`.
- **Any cross-repo write flow** — sibling-repo PRs (`permittedExternalPaths`) require local checkouts of those repos.

If a `/schedule`-triggered task needs to do real code work, the correct pattern today is: have the remote agent *file a backlog task or GitHub issue describing the work*, then a human (or local Claude Code session) picks it up and runs `/ai-sdlc execute` against it.

## RFCs

RFCs live in `spec/rfcs/RFC-NNNN-*.md`. The full process is in [`spec/rfcs/README.md`](spec/rfcs/README.md); the canonical template is [`spec/rfcs/RFC-0001-template.md`](spec/rfcs/RFC-0001-template.md).

### Lifecycle convention (AISDLC-118)

Every RFC carries a `lifecycle:` frontmatter field, separate from the per-owner sign-off checklist in the body. Values:

- **Draft** — initial brainstorm; structure may shift; sign-off boxes empty
- **Ready for Review** — structure stable; ready for owner sign-off; at least one owner signed
- **Signed Off** — all owners signed; design locked
- **Implemented** — corresponding milestone reached Done
- **Superseded** — replaced by a newer RFC (header notes the successor)

**Drafts land on main early.** As soon as the author considers an RFC shareable (typically after the first internal pass), open a PR that merges it to main with `lifecycle: Draft`. Stakeholders can then reference it at the canonical `spec/rfcs/RFC-NNNN-*.md` URL while iteration continues. Sign-off no longer gates visibility — the two questions (is it shareable? is it signed off?) are orthogonal. Hiding drafts until sign-off destroys the feedback loop the RFC process is supposed to create.

The legacy `status:` field (`Draft` / `Under Review` / `Approved` / `Implemented` / `Final` / `Rejected` / `Withdrawn`) is retained for back-compat with `scripts/check-rfc-docs.mjs` (which uses it to decide when to enforce the `requiresDocs` gate). New RFCs SHOULD set both fields. Mapping table is in `spec/rfcs/README.md`.

## Backlog Workflow

Backlog tasks live in `backlog/tasks/` (Backlog.md) and are managed via the `mcp__backlog__*` MCP tools. Every issue executed under the AI-SDLC pipeline MUST be tracked here.

### Filename constraint — ASCII only (AISDLC-92)

Task **titles** may use unicode for human readability (`—`, `→`, `≥`, etc.), but the resulting **filename** in `backlog/tasks/` and `backlog/completed/` must be ASCII-only until upstream Backlog.md ships a unicode-stripping fix. Background: PR #101 (AISDLC-90) was blocked when the auto-derived filename contained `—` and `→` — git's `core.quotepath=true` default octal-escaped + double-quoted the path in `git diff --name-only`, which broke the verifier's chore-commit allowlist regex (`^backlog/(tasks|completed)/.+\.md$`). The verifier was hardened (`-c core.quotepath=false`) but ASCII-only filenames are the defense-in-depth layer.

The `scripts/check-backlog-ascii.sh` pre-commit hook (wired in `.husky/pre-commit`) enforces this on staged additions/renames; it ignores legacy unicode-named files already in `backlog/completed/` so historical commits don't churn. To rename: `git mv "<unicode-name>.md" "<ascii-equivalent>.md"`. To retitle the task itself: `mcp__backlog__task_edit` with a new title, or rename the file and resync via `task_edit` to keep the frontmatter aligned.

### Strict drift gate — pre-commit + CI (AISDLC-119)

`backlog-drift` checks that every reference inside a task's frontmatter (file paths, dependency IDs, related URLs) actually resolves. The hook used to be **advisory** (`npx backlog-drift hook-run`) — it printed warnings and exited 0, which let 223 drift issues accumulate across 152 tasks despite running on every commit. AISDLC-119 made it **strict**: any commit that stages a `backlog/tasks/*.md` file with drift errors now fails.

#### How it works

- **Pre-commit (per-task, fast).** `.husky/pre-commit` invokes `scripts/check-backlog-drift.sh` (operator-wired — agent sandboxes can't edit `.husky/` directly; replace the legacy `npx backlog-drift hook-run` line with `./scripts/check-backlog-drift.sh`). The script collects staged `backlog/tasks/*.md` files (`--diff-filter=AM` — only Added or Modified, so the `tasks/` → `completed/` rename done by `task_complete` is excluded), extracts the task ID from each filename, and runs `npx backlog-drift check --task <id>` per task. Any non-zero exit blocks the commit. Performance budget is < 500ms for the typical 1-task commit; multi-task commits scale linearly with the number of staged tasks.
- **CI (full repo, defense-in-depth).** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has a `backlog-drift` job that runs `npx backlog-drift check` against the entire backlog. It catches drift introduced via merges (rebase conflicts, sibling-PR overlaps, file moves outside the dev's awareness) that the per-task pre-commit gate can't see. It's a required check via the `ci-ok` aggregator.

#### Escape hatches (use sparingly)

| Scenario | Command |
|---|---|
| Skip just the strict drift gate (lint-staged + typecheck still run) | `AI_SDLC_SKIP_DRIFT_GATE=1 git commit ...` |
| Skip the entire pre-commit pipeline | `git commit --no-verify` |

The CI step has no env-var escape — drift on a PR must either be fixed or `--no-verify`'d in a follow-up commit. (The 223-issue legacy backlog is a separate one-time cleanup task; the gate is "stop the bleeding" only.)

#### Auto-fix workflow

When the gate blocks a commit, the failure message lists each offending task and the fix command:

```
[backlog-drift] AISDLC-119 has drift errors:
  ✗ Referenced file no longer exists: backlog/tasks/aisdlc-117 - Compute-...md
  Run `npx backlog-drift fix --task AISDLC-119` to auto-fix.
```

`fix` rewrites the task file in place: removes deleted references, normalizes dependency IDs, drops orphan `(new)` placeholders. Stage the result and re-commit.

### Canonical execution paths

| Use case | Command | Billing | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Internal dogfood (backlog tasks)** | `/ai-sdlc execute <task-id>` (slash command) | Subscription (Claude Code Max) | Runs as Claude Code subagents. Worktree-isolated. Auto-creates sibling-repo PRs from `permittedExternalPaths`. Marks Done + moves file in the same PR. |
| **Manual ad-hoc cleanup** | `/ai-sdlc cleanup [<task-id>]` | n/a | Sweeps merged worktrees from `.worktrees/` (no args) or force-removes one (with task-id). Never deletes branches automatically. |
| **GitHub-issue / unattended / CI** | `pnpm --filter @ai-sdlc/dogfood watch --issue <id>` | API key | Orchestrator-driven (TypeScript service). Use this when a Claude Code session isn't available — webhooks, cron, contributor-PR workflow. |

For any internal task, default to `/ai-sdlc execute`. The orchestrator-driven path is reserved for unattended/programmatic use.

#### Dual-tier pipeline architecture (RFC-0012)

The Step 0-13 pipeline shared by all three execution paths above lives in `pipeline-cli/` (`@ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli`) — a workspace package that exposes the same step functions three ways:

- **Tier 1 — slash command body** (`/ai-sdlc execute`): the slash command body in `ai-sdlc-plugin/commands/execute.md` interleaves `ai-sdlc-pipeline <subcommand>` invocations (CLI shape) with main-session `Agent` tool calls for the LLM dispatch boundaries (Step 5b developer, Step 7b three reviewers in parallel). Subscription billing.
- **Tier 2 — `executePipeline()` composite** (TypeScript library): a single `import { executePipeline } from '@ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli'` + one async call drives Step 0-13 end-to-end. The two LLM dispatch boundaries go through an injected `SubagentSpawner` (subscription via `claude --print`, API key via `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` SDK, or `MockSpawner` for tests). Designed for unattended programmatic use: webhooks, cron, GitHub Actions, the `pnpm watch` flow.

Both tiers run the same step functions, so behaviour is identical — only the LLM dispatch boundary differs.

### Done semantics — `/ai-sdlc execute` vs other paths

- **`/ai-sdlc execute` path**: Done = "reviews-approved-and-PR-opened". The command marks Done + runs `task_complete` (moving the file to `backlog/completed/`) BEFORE pushing the PR, so the entire task lifecycle lands atomically in one PR. No follow-up workflow needed.
- **Other paths (orchestrator, manual, external contributors)**: Done = "merged". The `.github/workflows/backlog-task-complete.yml` workflow opens a follow-up PR after merge to flip status and move the file. The workflow is idempotent — when the file is already in `backlog/completed/` (because `/ai-sdlc execute` already moved it), the workflow short-circuits to a no-op.

### Cross-repo writes — `permittedExternalPaths`

Tasks that legitimately need to write into sibling git repos (e.g. AISDLC-68 writing into `../ai-sdlc-io/`) declare an allowlist in their frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: AISDLC-68
title: ...
permittedExternalPaths:
  - '../ai-sdlc-io/'
---
```

The PreToolUse hook reads this via a per-worktree sentinel `<worktree>/.active-task` (written by `/ai-sdlc execute` Step 4). Without the allowlist, writes outside the worktree are denied. With the allowlist, the developer subagent may write to the listed paths but does NOT commit there itself — `/ai-sdlc execute` Step 12 creates parallel PRs in the sibling repos. The env var `AI_SDLC_ACTIVE_TASK_ID` remains a fallback for tests / external tooling.

**Parallel runs are first-class — but parallelism is per-Claude-Code-session, not per-subagent (AISDLC-98).** The Step 0-13 pipeline lives inline in the `/ai-sdlc execute` slash command body (`ai-sdlc-plugin/commands/execute.md`). The slash command body runs in the main Claude Code session, which has the `Agent` tool, so it can spawn the developer + 3 reviewer subagents directly. Its tool grant is `Agent(developer, code-reviewer, test-reviewer, security-reviewer)` (`Task` was renamed to `Agent` in Claude Code v2.1.63; the allowlist form both grants the tool and restricts which subagent types may be spawned).

Why inline rather than a subagent middleman? AISDLC-82 originally moved the recipe into an `execute-orchestrator` subagent so a single main session could fan out N orchestrators in one message. That design is unimplementable on the current Claude Code harness: **plugin subagents cannot use the `Agent` tool, regardless of frontmatter declarations.** Empirical proof came from AISDLC-69.2's parallel-execution test, which returned `"No such tool available: Agent. Agent is not available inside subagents."` Claude Code filters `Agent` out of every plugin subagent's tool grant one level deep, and the allowlist form `Agent(developer, ...)` is silently dropped just the same. AISDLC-98 reverted AISDLC-82 and moved the pipeline back inline.

Parallel-run model under the new design:
- Each `/ai-sdlc execute <task-id>` invocation runs in its own Claude Code session — the main session DOES have `Agent`, so it spawns the developer + 3 reviewers directly without a middleman.
- For multiple tasks in flight, run `/loop /ai-sdlc execute <task-id>` (one task per loop tick, or fire the slash command from multiple terminal sessions). Each invocation is independent: its own worktree, its own per-worktree `.active-task` sentinel (AISDLC-81), its own developer + reviewer fan-out, its own PR. No shared project-level state to race on.
- `/loop /ai-sdlc execute <task-id>` is now the canonical parallel-throughput pattern — single developer + 3 reviewers per loop tick, sequenced by the loop driver.

Scaling notes:
- N parallel `/ai-sdlc execute` runs ⇒ up to **3N concurrent reviewer subagents** (each invocation spawns 3 reviewers in parallel at Step 7). Reviewers are read-only so file-system contention is fine.
- The husky `pre-push` hook in `.husky/pre-push` serialises across runs only at the push boundary (Step 11). Steps 5-10 (developer + reviews + attestation) run fully in parallel across concurrent invocations.

The legacy project-level `.worktrees/.active-task` sentinel from earlier versions still works as a fallback for one release but is no longer written by `/ai-sdlc execute`.

### Lifecycle rules

- **Create before execution.** When a plan includes multiple issues (e.g. an RFC implementation), create ALL backlog tasks BEFORE starting work on any of them. Use `mcp__backlog__task_create` with `milestone` + `labels` + acceptance criteria.
- **Claim on start.** Flip status to `In Progress` via `mcp__backlog__task_edit` the moment you begin coding a task. (Handled automatically by `/ai-sdlc execute`.) Don't stack multiple tasks in progress unless they're actually being worked in parallel.
- **Complete — two steps, both required:**
  1. `mcp__backlog__task_edit` with `status: 'Done'`, `acceptanceCriteriaCheck: [1, 2, ...]`, and `finalSummary` documenting changes / design decisions / verification / follow-up.
  2. `mcp__backlog__task_complete` to **physically move the file from `backlog/tasks/` to `backlog/completed/`**. `task_edit` alone only flips the status field — the file stays in `tasks/` until `task_complete` archives it. A task isn't actually closed in the repo until it's in `backlog/completed/`.

  When using `/ai-sdlc execute`, both steps run automatically after reviews approve. When using other paths, run them yourself OR rely on the `backlog-task-complete.yml` post-merge workflow.
- **Never leave "To Do" after implementation.** If you finish work on AISDLC-N, AISDLC-N must be in `backlog/completed/` before (or atomically with) the PR merge. Retroactive close-out is acceptable, blank close-out is not.

### `finalSummary` template

```markdown
## Summary
<one-paragraph description of what shipped>

## Changes
- `path/to/file.ts` (new|modified): <what changed and why>
- ...

## Design decisions
- **<Decision>**: <reason>. <tradeoff or context>.
- ...

## Verification
- `pnpm build` — clean
- `pnpm vitest run <test-file>` — N/N pass
- `pnpm test` (full workspace) — <counts>, no regressions
- `pnpm lint` — clean

## Follow-up
<what unblocks next, what to do in a future PR, or "closes milestone M-N">
```

### When NOT to create a backlog task

- Inline fixes caught during review (use the PR itself).
- Trivial chores — dependency bumps, config tweaks, typo fixes.
- Exploration / spikes — if it becomes real work, retroactively create a task.

### Status-value conventions

- Backlog task statuses: `Draft`, `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`. Use `Draft` for tasks that aren't ready to execute (missing AC, blocked on decisions) and `To Do` for ready work.
- Task IDs: `AISDLC-<N>` is the standard prefix for project work. Sub-project task IDs (e.g. external contrib) follow their own conventions.

### Verification before closing

Run the full workspace test suite and lint BEFORE flipping to `Done`:

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm lint
```

Cite the counts in `finalSummary`. If you can't reproduce the counts in the task description, the task isn't done.

### Close-out checklist (end of task)

```
□ mcp__backlog__task_edit     → status: Done, acceptanceCriteriaCheck, finalSummary
□ mcp__backlog__task_complete  → moves file from tasks/ → completed/
□ verify with mcp__backlog__task_list (status: Done) that the task appears in the Done list
```

The file location is the source of truth: `backlog/tasks/<id>-*.md` = open, `backlog/completed/<id>-*.md` = closed. `task_edit` sets the status field inside the file but does NOT move it; `task_complete` does both.

## Releases

### Publishable package configs (AISDLC-97)

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs `pnpm -r publish --no-git-checks` with **no `--access` flag**. That means every workspace package whose `package.json` is NOT marked `"private": true` MUST carry its own publishConfig block:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "@ai-sdlc/<thing>",
  // ...
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public",
    "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
  }
}
```

Without it, npm rejects the publish with:

```
npm error code E402
npm error 402 Payment Required - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/@ai-sdlc%2f... - You must sign up for private packages
```

Scoped packages default to private on the npm registry, and the release workflow has no override.

#### Why this is a CLAUDE.md rule

Forensic AISDLC-97 investigation: `@ai-sdlc/plugin-mcp-server` v0.8.0 + v0.8.1 both **silently failed to publish**. The release workflow ran, npm rejected mcp-server with E402, but the publish job overall didn't visibly bubble up the failure as "this package never shipped" — it looked like a normal CI hiccup. Result: two consecutive ai-sdlc-plugin minor bumps shipped to git tags but only the second-to-last package made it to npm. The fix commit `1c8b584` was the FIRST time `publishConfig` had ever been added to that package's `package.json` on main; the original "fix in PR #54" memory was wrong — it had never actually been committed.

#### How to spot-check before merging a release-please PR

```bash
# Diff every publishable package's publishConfig against the spec.
pnpm lint:publishable
```

The script (`scripts/check-publishable-package-configs.mjs`) walks every entry in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, skips `"private": true` packages, and asserts the rest carry `publishConfig.access: "public"` AND `publishConfig.registry: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"`. Exit 0 = green; exit 1 = something will fail to publish on the next release.

It's wired into `pnpm test` (via `pnpm test:publishable`) so the tree-wide test run catches regressions, but the operator should also wire it as an explicit CI step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (the workflow file is blocked from the developer subagent — this is a follow-up):

```yaml
- name: Lint publishable package configs
  run: pnpm lint:publishable
```

#### How to add a new publishable package without forgetting

1. Create the package under a workspace path and add it to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
2. In its `package.json`, decide:
   - **Internal-only?** Add `"private": true` — done; the lint will skip it.
   - **Publishing to npm?** Add the `publishConfig` block above before any other field after `"exports"`. Run `pnpm lint:publishable` to confirm green.
3. If release-please should track its version, add it under `packages` in `release-please-config.json`.

#### Why release-please can't fix this for us

`release-please-config.json` only updates the `$.version` jsonpath of `mcp-server/package.json` (declared as an `extra-files` entry). It does NOT regenerate the file from a template, and it does NOT add or strip `publishConfig`. So the field is preserved across release-please runs once it's checked in — but release-please will never *add* it for you. The lint is the only safety net.

## Plugin MCP server — project-root discovery (AISDLC-99)

The plugin's MCP server (`ai-sdlc-plugin/mcp-server/`) exposes filesystem-touching tools (`mcp__plugin_ai-sdlc_ai-sdlc__task_edit`, `mcp__plugin_ai-sdlc_ai-sdlc__task_complete`, `get_governance_context`, `get_review_policy`) that need to know which directory is "the project". Resolution happens in this order at every tool call:

1. **`AI_SDLC_PROJECT_ROOT` env var** — used only if it points at an existing directory containing a `backlog/` subdirectory. The plugin's `plugin.json` sets this to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` (which resolves to `~/.claude/plugins/data/<source>-<plugin>/`); that path has no `backlog/`, so the resolver transparently falls through.
2. **`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` env var** — same `backlog/` validity check. Claude Code sets this when a session is bound to a project.
3. **Walk up from `process.cwd()`** — find the nearest ancestor with a `backlog/` subdirectory. This is the path that actually wins for `task_edit` / `task_complete` calls in a normal Claude Code session opened inside an AI-SDLC project.
4. **Throw** — if none of the above resolves, the tool returns a clear error: `"AI-SDLC: could not resolve project root. Set AI_SDLC_PROJECT_ROOT or run from a directory inside a project with a backlog/ subdirectory."`

This means you almost never need to set anything by hand. Just open Claude Code in your project (or any subdirectory of it) and the plugin's task tools will operate on the correct `backlog/`. To override (e.g. point at a different checkout) export `AI_SDLC_PROJECT_ROOT=/abs/path/to/project` before launching Claude Code.
