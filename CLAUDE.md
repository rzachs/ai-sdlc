# AI-SDLC Project Instructions

## Git Flow

- **Always rebase** feature branches onto main; never merge main in.
- Update branch: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`, then `git push --force-with-lease`.
- Never `gh api pulls/N/update-branch` with merge method. Keep linear history.
- `/ai-sdlc rebase <pr>` automates mechanical conflicts (CHANGELOG `Unreleased`, test additions to same `describe`, prettier drift) and re-signs the attestation only when `contentHash` changed. Escalates semantic conflicts, modify-vs-delete, verification failures, and 3-attempt iteration cap. Refuses force-push to `main`/`master`.

## CI marker hygiene

GitHub Actions silently skips ALL workflows when ANY commit body contains `[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `[no ci]`, `[skip actions]`, or `[actions skip]` (substring, case-insensitive). Use the paren-quoted form `(skip ci marker)` in commit messages. Backtick-wrapping does NOT defeat the parser. `scripts/check-skip-ci-marker.sh` enforces on push.

## Branches & Commits

- Branches: `feat/<desc>`, `fix/<desc>`, or `ai-sdlc/issue-<n>`.
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `style:`).
- Include `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## PRs

- **Never merge PRs** — only humans merge.
- **Never close** issues or PRs. **Never force-push to main/master.**
- Dismiss stale reviews only with documented reason (truncation, API errors).
- `auto-enable-auto-merge.yml` sets `--auto --rebase` on same-repo PRs (forks excluded; re-fires on synchronize/reopened). Setting `--auto` is NOT merging; GitHub merges once required checks pass.

## Testing

- Run `pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm lint && pnpm format:check` before pushing.
- `.husky/pre-push` is the canonical gate; local pre-flight makes it a no-op.
- Hook scripts (`ai-sdlc-plugin/hooks/*.js`) use Node built-in `node --test`. Orchestrator + MCP server use Vitest.

## Hooks

`.husky/pre-push` chains in order:

1. **`scripts/check-coverage.sh`** — 80% lines coverage threshold per package. Skip: `AI_SDLC_SKIP_COVERAGE_GATE=1`.
2. **`scripts/check-attestation-sign.sh`** — auto-signs DSSE attestation when `<worktree>/.active-task` exists, `<worktree>/.ai-sdlc/verdicts/<task-id-lower>.json` exists, and no envelope at HEAD. Commits the envelope as a separate `chore: auto-sign attestation for <task-id>` and exits 1 with "re-run git push". Idempotent on the second push (envelope-at-HEAD or HEAD-is-auto-sign-chore predicate). Skip: `AI_SDLC_SKIP_ATTESTATION_SIGN=1`.

`set -euo pipefail` aborts on first failure. `git push --no-verify` bypasses everything. Both gates have hermetic tests at `scripts/<name>.test.mjs` wired via `pnpm test:drift-gate` / `test:attestation-sign-gate`.

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict, ESM. Prettier + ESLint. No premature abstractions — three similar lines beat one wrong abstraction.

## Review attestations (AISDLC-74)

`/ai-sdlc execute` runs three reviewer subagents (code/test/security) locally and signs a DSSE envelope CI verifies; valid envelope skips the duplicate CI review run.

**Bootstrap** (one time per machine): `/ai-sdlc init-signing-key` generates `~/.ai-sdlc/signing-key.pem` (ed25519, mode 0600, never committed). It prints a YAML block — open a PR adding it to `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml`.

**Files**:
- `~/.ai-sdlc/signing-key.pem` — private key (operator only)
- `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml` — pubkey allowlist (committed)
- `.ai-sdlc/attestations/<commit-sha>.dsse.json` — per-commit signed envelopes (committed audit trail, ~1-2KB)
- `.ai-sdlc/schemas/attestation.v3.schema.json` — current allowlist `['v3']`

**Verifier behavior** (`verify-attestation.yml` on `pull_request` + `merge_group`): scans `.ai-sdlc/attestations/*.dsse.json`, recomputes content bindings (`contentHashV3`, policy hash, agent file hashes, plugin/schema versions) against current PR state. Sets commit status `ai-sdlc/attestation` to `valid` or `invalid (<reason>)`. Posts an idempotent fallback PR comment on missing/invalid (marker: `<!-- ai-sdlc:attestation-fallback-comment -->`).

**`contentHashV3`** is the single content binding: `sha256({path, fileDeltaHash} per changed file, sorted)` where `fileDeltaHash[path] = sha256(<base_blob_sha> + ' -> ' + <head_blob_sha>)` and base = `git merge-base(<baseRef>, <headRef>)`. Rebase-stable, sibling-overlap-tolerant. Re-runs of `/ai-sdlc execute` produce fresh envelopes.

**Docs-only PRs** (paths matching `spec/rfcs/**`, `docs/**`, `backlog/{tasks,completed}/**`, root `*.md`) skip both reviewer fan-out (`ai-sdlc-review.yml`) and attestation verification (`verify-attestation.yml`) via `paths-ignore`. To prevent merge deadlock from the required `Post Review Results` check never posting, the orthogonal `ai-sdlc-review-docs-only.yml` workflow detects docs-only changesets and posts `Post Review Results: success` directly. Mixed PRs take the normal review path. The `verify-attestation.yml` `merge_group` trigger remains unfiltered for queue-head defense in depth. To force a real review on a docs-only PR, push a tiny non-docs change (no `workflow_dispatch` trigger today).

**Force-push recovery**: PRs with valid attestations get a fresh `gh pr review --approve` posted by the skip-when-attestation-valid step so branch protection's `dismiss_stale_reviews: true` doesn't strand auto-merge.

## CI-side attestor (AISDLC-87)

For PRs without a local key (forks, remote-agent runs, external contributors): `ai-sdlc-review.yml` calls `scripts/ci-sign-attestation.mjs` after the 3 CI reviewer agents all approve, signs with `AI_SDLC_CI_ATTESTOR_PRIVATE_KEY`, and pushes a `chore(ci): sign review attestation [skip ci]` commit (the only allowed `[skip ci]` use; authored by `ai-sdlc-ci-attestor[bot]`). Same DSSE format as maintainer-signed. Same-repo PRs only — fork PRs need a maintainer to pull into a same-repo branch first. Bootstrap is one-time maintainer-only setup (ed25519 keypair → `AI_SDLC_CI_ATTESTOR_PRIVATE_KEY` GH secret + pubkey added under `ci-attestor` in `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml`); see `scripts/ci-sign-attestation.mjs` and `.github/workflows/ai-sdlc-review.yml` for the exact env vars + permissions.

**Trust model**: CI-attestor key has the same trust as a maintainer key. Rotate on suspected leak. Refuses to sign on `CHANGES_REQUESTED`.

## Remote agents (`/schedule`) — read-only by design

CCR remote sandboxes have no signing key, no plugin install, no worktree, no operator filesystem. Treat them as read-only.

**Acceptable**: PR/backlog status surveys, cron metric digests, Slack workflows, CI run-list / flake detection.
**Prohibited**: `/ai-sdlc execute`, signing-key flows, plugin subagents (`developer`, `code-reviewer`, etc.), worktree ops, sibling-repo writes.

If a `/schedule` task needs real code work, have it file a backlog task or GitHub issue describing the work — a local Claude Code session picks it up.

## RFCs

Live in `spec/rfcs/RFC-NNNN-*.md`. Process: [`spec/rfcs/README.md`](spec/rfcs/README.md). Template: [`spec/rfcs/RFC-0001-template.md`](spec/rfcs/RFC-0001-template.md).

**Lifecycle field** (frontmatter, separate from sign-off checklist): `Draft` → `Ready for Review` → `Signed Off` → `Implemented`, or `Superseded`. Drafts land on main early — sign-off doesn't gate visibility. Legacy `status:` field retained for `scripts/check-rfc-docs.mjs`'s `requiresDocs` gate.

## Backlog Workflow

Tasks live in `backlog/tasks/` (open) and `backlog/completed/` (closed); managed via `mcp__backlog__*` MCP tools. Filename **must be ASCII**; titles may use unicode (`scripts/check-backlog-ascii.sh` enforces on commit).

### Drift gate

`backlog-drift` checks every reference in task frontmatter resolves. Strict on commit (per-task pre-commit) + CI (full repo, defense-in-depth via `backlog-drift` job). Skip just the gate: `AI_SDLC_SKIP_DRIFT_GATE=1`. Auto-fix: `npx backlog-drift fix --task AISDLC-N`.

### Canonical execution paths

| Use case | Command | Billing |
|---|---|---|
| Internal dogfood (backlog tasks) | `/ai-sdlc execute <task-id>` | Subscription (Claude Code Max) |
| Manual cleanup | `/ai-sdlc cleanup [<task-id>]` | n/a |
| GitHub issue / unattended / CI | `pnpm --filter @ai-sdlc/dogfood watch --issue <id>` | API key |

`/ai-sdlc execute` is the default for internal work. Worktree-isolated, auto-creates sibling-repo PRs from `permittedExternalPaths`, marks Done + moves task file in the same PR.

The Step 0-13 pipeline lives in `pipeline-cli/` (`@ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli`). Tier 1 = slash command body (subscription). Tier 2 = `executePipeline()` library + `SubagentSpawner` injection (API-key, MockSpawner, etc.). Refs: `pipeline-cli/{README,docs/spawner,docs/steps}.md`, RFC-0012.

### Done semantics

- **`/ai-sdlc execute` path**: Done = "reviews-approved-and-PR-opened". Task file is moved to `backlog/completed/` BEFORE push.
- **Other paths**: Done = "merged". `.github/workflows/backlog-task-complete.yml` opens a follow-up PR after merge (idempotent — no-op if file is already in completed/).

### Cross-repo writes — `permittedExternalPaths`

Tasks needing sibling-repo writes (e.g. `../ai-sdlc-io/`) declare an allowlist:

```yaml
permittedExternalPaths:
  - '../ai-sdlc-io/'
```

The PreToolUse hook reads `<worktree>/.active-task` (per-worktree sentinel, AISDLC-81) to resolve which allowlist applies. Without the file, cross-repo writes are denied. The developer subagent writes; `/ai-sdlc execute` Step 12 creates the parallel sibling PRs. Env fallback: `AI_SDLC_ACTIVE_TASK_ID`.

### Parallel runs

Each `/ai-sdlc execute` runs in its own Claude Code session with its own per-worktree sentinel. Fan out via `/loop /ai-sdlc execute <task-id>` or multiple terminals — no shared mutable state to race on. Pre-push hook serializes only at push (Step 11); Steps 5-10 run fully in parallel across runs.

Plugin subagents cannot use the `Agent` tool (Claude Code filters it one level deep — verified via AISDLC-69.2 test). The pipeline therefore lives inline in the slash command body, not in a subagent middleman (AISDLC-82 reverted by AISDLC-98).

### Lifecycle rules

- **Create-before-execution**: when a plan spans multiple tasks, create them ALL via `mcp__backlog__task_create` first.
- **Claim on start**: status → `In Progress` (auto by `/ai-sdlc execute`).
- **Complete = TWO steps**: `mcp__backlog__task_edit` (status, ACs, finalSummary) + `mcp__backlog__task_complete` (moves file). File location is source of truth. Run the workspace test suite + lint before flipping.
- **Never leave `To Do` after implementation.** A task isn't closed until it's in `backlog/completed/`.

### `finalSummary` template

```markdown
## Summary
<one-paragraph: what shipped>

## Changes
- `path/to/file.ts` (new|modified): <what + why>

## Design decisions
- **<Decision>**: <reason + tradeoff>

## Verification
- `pnpm build` — clean
- `pnpm test` — <counts>
- `pnpm lint` — clean

## Follow-up
<next steps or "(none)">
```

### When NOT to create a backlog task

- Inline fixes caught during review (use the PR).
- Trivial chores (deps, config, typos).
- Exploration/spikes (retroactively if it becomes real work).

## Releases

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs `pnpm -r publish --no-git-checks` with no `--access` flag. Every non-`"private": true` workspace package MUST carry:

```jsonc
"publishConfig": { "access": "public", "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/" }
```

Without it, npm rejects with E402 silently per-package while the overall job appears green. `pnpm lint:publishable` (wired into `pnpm test`) catches regressions; the operator should also wire it as an explicit CI step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

When adding a new publishable package: add to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, add the `publishConfig` block (or mark `"private": true`), add to `release-please-config.json` if release-please should track its version. release-please does NOT add `publishConfig` automatically.

## Plugin MCP server — project root resolution (AISDLC-99)

The plugin's MCP server (`mcp__plugin_ai-sdlc_ai-sdlc__*` tools) resolves the project directory in this order: `AI_SDLC_PROJECT_ROOT` env → `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` env → walk up from `process.cwd()` for an ancestor with `backlog/` → throw. Almost always falls through to the cwd-walk and finds the right project. Override with `AI_SDLC_PROJECT_ROOT=/abs/path` before launching Claude Code.
