/**
 * Verify the DSSE review attestation for the current PR against the committed
 * `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml` and the current PR state (AISDLC-74).
 *
 * Used by `.github/workflows/verify-attestation.yml`. Extracted from the
 * workflow YAML so it can be unit-tested + run locally.
 *
 * AISDLC-84: rebase-stable matching. The verifier no longer matches envelopes
 * by filename SHA — every SHA-keyed scheme broke under local rebase (the
 * user's actual workflow when stacking PRs onto main), under merge-queue
 * rebase, and under force-push that rewrites SHAs without changing reviewed
 * CONTENT. We match by recomputing the predicate's content-bound fields
 * against current PR state.
 *
 * AISDLC-85: chore-commit-on-top regression fix. AISDLC-84 hashed the diff
 * `<base>...<PR_HEAD>` once and compared it against every envelope's
 * `predicate.diffHash`. That fails the standard `/ai-sdlc execute` shape:
 * sign-attestation runs at `git rev-parse HEAD` (the dev commit), THEN a
 * chore commit lands on top moving the task file + adding the attestation
 * file. The envelope's diffHash was computed against `<base>...<dev-sha>`,
 * not `<base>...<PR_HEAD>` — they don't match, even though the reviewed
 * content (the dev commit's diff) is unchanged.
 *
 * Fix: per envelope, recompute `git diff <base>...<envelope.subject.sha1>`
 * and compare to `predicate.diffHash`. The subject SHA is the dev commit
 * the envelope was signed against. We also re-introduce the AISDLC-76
 * chore-commit allowlist: after matching by subject, the diff
 * `<subject>...<PR_HEAD>` (= the chore commit's diff) MUST contain only
 * paths under `.ai-sdlc/attestations/<sha>.dsse.json` or
 * `backlog/{tasks,completed}/<id>.md`. Otherwise an attacker could land
 * malicious code in a chore commit and have the dev-commit's stale
 * attestation pass.
 *
 * If the envelope's subject SHA is NOT reachable from PR HEAD (post-rebase:
 * ancestry was rewritten), we fall back to walking PR HEAD's first-parent
 * chain (default depth 5, env-tunable via AI_SDLC_VERIFIER_ANCESTOR_DEPTH)
 * and trying each ancestor as the candidate subject — the FIRST ancestor
 * whose recomputed diff matches the envelope's `predicate.diffHash` wins.
 *
 * Threat-model trade-off (preserved from AISDLC-84): we lose the binding
 * "this attestation was signed against THIS commit SHA". Every CONTENT
 * binding (diff/policy/agents/plugin-version/schema) is preserved, AND the
 * chore-commit allowlist closes the malicious-chore-commit attack surface
 * AISDLC-84 had inadvertently opened.
 *
 * AISDLC-448: v6 envelope head-binding relaxation extended to BOTH-mismatch.
 * Root cause of 4 BLOCKED PRs on 2026-05-27: the AISDLC-419 attestation-only
 * descendant relaxation only fires when subject.sha1 is reachable from HEAD
 * (linear chore-commit case). After a rebase, the envelope's subject is
 * orphaned (no longer in HEAD's ancestor chain), so the ancestor check
 * fails AND the descendant relaxation never runs. We added a second
 * relaxation, `isTreeEquivalentModuloAttestation`, which checks tree
 * equivalence between the orphaned subject and HEAD modulo attestation
 * paths. Security argument: the v6 envelope's Merkle root + trusted-key
 * signature still gates acceptance (steps 3-7 of `verifyV6Envelope`); the
 * tree-equivalence check only relaxes the head-binding precondition for
 * envelopes whose source content matches HEAD. See
 * `isTreeEquivalentModuloAttestation` head-block for the full analysis.
 *
 * Inputs (env vars):
 *   PR_HEAD_SHA  — head SHA of the PR being verified (used for diff computation)
 *   PR_BASE_SHA  — base SHA (typically `origin/main`'s tip the PR is targeting)
 *
 * Outputs (printed to stdout, KEY=VALUE shape suitable for GITHUB_OUTPUT):
 *   status=valid|invalid
 *   reason=ok | <human-readable failure reason>
 *
 * The workflow appends these to $GITHUB_OUTPUT and uses them to set the
 * `ai-sdlc/attestation` commit status.

 * AISDLC-448: detect "tree-equivalent modulo attestation" relationship.

 * `headSha` are byte-identical EXCEPT for files under the attestation paths
 * (`.ai-sdlc/attestations/`, `.ai-sdlc/transcript-leaves.jsonl`,
 * `.ai-sdlc/transcript-leaves/`).
 *
 * Unlike `isAttestationOnlyDescendant`, this DOES NOT require `subjectSha`
 * to be an ancestor of `headSha`. It is therefore safe to use when the
 * envelope's subject SHA has been orphaned by a rebase — the rebased HEAD
 * still encodes the same source-tree content that the (orphaned) subject
 * tree encoded, and the v6 envelope's transcript binding still attests to
 * that content via the trusted-reviewer-signed Merkle root.
 *
 * Use case: the pattern observed in the 2026-05-27 incident (4 BLOCKED PRs)
 * is: sign-attestation runs against the dev commit; rebase onto main moves
 * dev's commit (orphaning the signed SHA); a chore commit lands on top
 * containing the post-rebase attestation file. The verifier sees:
 *   - filename mismatch (envelope is patch-id-named or pre-rebase SHA-named)
 *   - subject mismatch (envelope.subject.sha1 is the orphaned dev SHA)
 *   - subject NOT an ancestor of HEAD (orphaned by rebase)
 * Under AISDLC-419 alone, this is rejected. Under AISDLC-448, the tree-
 * equivalence check accepts it because: a clean rebase preserves the source
 * tree byte-for-byte (only the commit graph changes), and the chore commit
 * on top only touches `.ai-sdlc/attestations/**` + transcript-leaves.
 *
 * Security analysis:
 *   - The v6 envelope is signed by a trusted reviewer key over a Merkle
 *     root computed from on-disk transcript leaves. The signature does not
 *     depend on commit-SHA ancestry; it binds to leaf content.
 *   - Cross-PR replay surface: an attacker would need to land HEAD content
 *     whose source-tree (modulo attestation paths) exactly matches a
 *     historic envelope's subject-tree (modulo attestation paths). That
 *     IS the same source tree that was reviewed. Re-using the envelope
 *     does not grant approval for any NEW source content; it merely
 *     re-asserts approval for content that was already reviewed. The
 *     transcript-leaves + Merkle proof + trusted-key signature gates
 *     remain in force (steps 3-7 of `verifyV6Envelope`).
 *   - Tampering surface: any source-tree divergence (a stray comment,
 *     reformatted whitespace, anything outside the attestation paths)
 *     produces non-empty `git diff` output and the function returns false.
 *
 * The two relaxations compose:
 *   - `isAttestationOnlyDescendant` covers the linear case (subject is
 *     ancestor of HEAD, only attestation diffs in between). This handles
 *     the stacked chore-commit pattern.
 *   - `isTreeEquivalentModuloAttestation` covers the orphan case (subject
 *     is NOT ancestor of HEAD due to rebase). This handles the rebase +
 *     chore-commit pattern.
 *
 * Callers should attempt `isAttestationOnlyDescendant` FIRST (cheaper —
 * stops at the ancestor check) and fall through to this function only
 * when the ancestor check fails.

 * Recompute `contentHashV5` for `<headSha>` using the FROZEN `signedMergeBase`
 * embedded in the envelope predicate (AISDLC-362, fixed AISDLC-369).
 *
 * The key difference from `computeHeadContentHashV4`:
 *   - v4 enumerates files via `baseSha...headSha` (moving diff base).
 *   - v5 enumerates files via `signedMergeBase..headSha` (FROZEN diff base),
 *     with sibling-file exclusion when `currentBaseSha` is provided.
 *
 * AISDLC-369 FIX — sibling-file exclusion:
 *   After a merge-queue rebase, `signedMergeBase..headSha` grows to include
 *   files from sibling PRs that merged between signedMergeBase and headSha.
 *   This is the root cause of v5 failing for non-overlapping sibling merges.
 *
 *   Fix: when `currentBaseSha` is provided (= the merge_group base SHA or
 *   the current PR base SHA), we EXCLUDE files that appear in
 *   `signedMergeBase..currentBaseSha` from the enumeration. These are the
 *   "sibling-only" files — they were contributed by PRs that merged BEFORE
 *   ours in the queue. Our PR didn't touch them; excluding them gives the
 *   same file set as the original sign-time diff.
 *
 *   When `currentBaseSha` equals `signedMergeBase` (no sibling merges between
 *   them) the exclude set is empty and behavior is identical to the pre-fix
 *   algorithm.
 *
 * The frozen merge-base is read from the predicate; the verifier does NOT
 * recompute it — using the frozen value is what makes v5 stable across
 * non-overlapping sibling merges.

 *
 * AISDLC-193.1 added a v4 fast-path: when the envelope carries

 * (`source='v4-subject'` if the envelope's subject SHA is still

 * against the FROZEN merge-base and short-circuit on match. v5 is checked
 * BEFORE v4 because it is more rebase-stable.
 *
 * Algorithm (AISDLC-103, Verifier Phase 3 — v3-only):
 *  1. If `subject.digest.sha1` is well-formed AND reachable from PR HEAD
 *     (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`), recompute the per-file (base,

 *  2. Otherwise walk PR HEAD's first-parent ancestors up to `depth` and
 *     return the first ancestor whose recomputed `contentHashV3` equals
 *     `predicate.contentHashV3` (source='ancestor').
 *  3. Otherwise return `null` — the envelope's content doesn't correspond
 *     to any reachable commit on this branch.
 *
 * The legacy v1 (`diffHash`) and v2 (`contentHash`) acceptance legs were
 * dropped in this phase — `validatePredicateShape` already rejects v3
 * envelopes that carry either field, so even if a stale leg matched we'd
 * never reach this code path with a valid v3 envelope.
 *
 * Exported for unit testing. The injected `gitFn` lets tests stub git.

  // Those files are still on disk but the SHA in their filename no longer
  // maps to any commit on the branch. The verifier previously fell through
  // to the content-hash matching loop and surfaced a confusing
  // `contentHashV4 mismatch` even when the freshly-signed envelope was
  // valid.
  //
  // Surface a clear, actionable error BEFORE the content-hash loop so
  // the operator sees the real problem and the exact recovery command.
  //
  // When orphans are detected we return immediately with the actionable
  // message — there's no point running the hash-matching loop because the
  // multi-envelope state itself is the thing to fix first.
  //
  // Only run this check when we have more than one envelope on disk, or
  // when the diff scan shows ≥1 orphan (multi-envelope being the
  // overwhelming common case for this bug, but the check also catches a
  // single orphan from a clean-rebase-then-re-sign cycle).
  // AISDLC-362 follow-up: orphan-envelope hard-reject REMOVED.
  // The orphan check rejected envelopes whose subject.digest.sha1 (pre-rebase
  // commit) couldn't be found in the rebased commit graph. With V5 (AISDLC-362),
  // the content hash itself is the trust boundary — an orphan subject SHA is
  // moot if V5 hash matches HEAD's file blobs. The check was firing on every
  // queue rebase even when V5 would have validated cleanly, blocking parallel
  // merges. V5 + per-envelope resolveSubjectShaForEnvelope() (which already
  // falls back to 'v5-head' when subject SHA isn't reachable) provides the
  // trust binding without needing the orphan pre-check.

  // Per-envelope: try to resolve a subject SHA whose recomputed
  // `contentHashV3` matches the envelope (AISDLC-103, Verifier Phase 3 —
  // v3 is the only content binding now). If we find one, the envelope is
  // content-matched (modulo policy / agents / plugin version / schema,
  // which are checked by `predicateMatchReason` using the envelope's own

  // validation, schemaVersion allowlist re-check, signature check, and the
  // reviewer-set completeness check. `commitSha` is set to the predicate's
  // own subject so the runtime's "subject digest mismatch" path is a no-op
  // (we deliberately don't enforce the SHA at the runtime layer — the
  // verifier-side ancestor walk above is the source of truth for which
  // commit the envelope binds to).
  //
  // AISDLC-103: `contentHashV3` is passed; AISDLC-193.1: also forward
  // `contentHashV4` (when the envelope carries it) so the runtime
  // verifier's v4-prefer path is exercised; AISDLC-362: also forward
  // `contentHashV5` for v5 envelopes. All values forwarded from the
  // envelope's own predicate since we've already content-matched upstream
  // — the runtime check is identity-equal by construction.
