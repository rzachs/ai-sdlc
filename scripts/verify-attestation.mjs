/**
 * Verify the DSSE review attestation for the current PR against the committed
 * `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml` and the current PR state (AISDLC-74).
 *
 * Used by `.github/workflows/verify-attestation.yml`. Extracted from the
 * workflow YAML so it can be unit-tested + run locally.
 *
 * AISDLC-84: rebase-stable matching. The verifier no longer matches envelopes
 * by filename SHA — every SHA-keyed scheme broke under local rebase (the
 * user's actual workflow when stacking PRs onto main), under merge-queue
 * rebase, and under force-push that rewrites SHAs without changing reviewed
 * CONTENT. We match by recomputing the predicate's content-bound fields
 * against current PR state.
 *
 * AISDLC-85: chore-commit-on-top regression fix. AISDLC-84 hashed the diff
 * `<base>...<PR_HEAD>` once and compared it against every envelope's
 * `predicate.diffHash`. That fails the standard `/ai-sdlc execute` shape:
 * sign-attestation runs at `git rev-parse HEAD` (the dev commit), THEN a
 * chore commit lands on top moving the task file + adding the attestation
 * file. The envelope's diffHash was computed against `<base>...<dev-sha>`,
 * not `<base>...<PR_HEAD>` — they don't match, even though the reviewed
 * content (the dev commit's diff) is unchanged.
 *
 * Fix: per envelope, recompute `git diff <base>...<envelope.subject.sha1>`
 * and compare to `predicate.diffHash`. The subject SHA is the dev commit
 * the envelope was signed against. We also re-introduce the AISDLC-76
 * chore-commit allowlist: after matching by subject, the diff
 * `<subject>...<PR_HEAD>` (= the chore commit's diff) MUST contain only
 * paths under `.ai-sdlc/attestations/<sha>.dsse.json` or
 * `backlog/{tasks,completed}/<id>.md`. Otherwise an attacker could land
 * malicious code in a chore commit and have the dev-commit's stale
 * attestation pass.
 *
 * If the envelope's subject SHA is NOT reachable from PR HEAD (post-rebase:
 * ancestry was rewritten), we fall back to walking PR HEAD's first-parent
 * chain (default depth 5, env-tunable via AI_SDLC_VERIFIER_ANCESTOR_DEPTH)
 * and trying each ancestor as the candidate subject — the FIRST ancestor
 * whose recomputed diff matches the envelope's `predicate.diffHash` wins.
 *
 * Threat-model trade-off (preserved from AISDLC-84): we lose the binding
 * "this attestation was signed against THIS commit SHA". Every CONTENT
 * binding (diff/policy/agents/plugin-version/schema) is preserved, AND the
 * chore-commit allowlist closes the malicious-chore-commit attack surface
 * AISDLC-84 had inadvertently opened.
 *
 * Inputs (env vars):
 *   PR_HEAD_SHA  — head SHA of the PR being verified (used for diff computation)
 *   PR_BASE_SHA  — base SHA (typically `origin/main`'s tip the PR is targeting)
 *
 * Outputs (printed to stdout, KEY=VALUE shape suitable for GITHUB_OUTPUT):
 *   status=valid|invalid
 *   reason=ok | <human-readable failure reason>
 *
 * The workflow appends these to $GITHUB_OUTPUT and uses them to set the
 * `ai-sdlc/attestation` commit status.
