# AISDLC-133: Auto-sign DSSE review attestation in the pre-push hook when
# verdict files exist. This removes the "sign-attestation" step from the
# LLM's responsibility per the "anything mechanical → hook/workflow, never
# LLM" pattern (2026-05-01 design discussion).
#
# Why this exists: `/ai-sdlc execute` Step 10 used to drive signing inline
# from the slash command body, which (a) consumed model context for a purely
# deterministic operation and (b) coupled signing to a successful main-session
# turn. Moving signing into pre-push makes it idempotent, automatic, and
# survives session restarts (verdict file lives in the worktree, not /tmp/).
#
# Behaviour:
#
#   1. Honour AI_SDLC_SKIP_ATTESTATION_SIGN=1 (operator deferral / hand-resign).
#   2. Read the per-worktree active-task sentinel at `<worktree>/.active-task`
#      (per AISDLC-81). Sentinel absent → exit 0 (chore PRs, ad-hoc commits,
#      docs-only PRs all push without an attestation).
#   3. Read the verdict file at `<worktree>/.ai-sdlc/verdicts/<task-id>.json`.
#      Verdict file absent → exit 0 (reviewers haven't run yet; the verdict
#      file is the explicit "we're ready to attest" handoff from /ai-sdlc
#      execute). Note: docs-only PRs are handled entirely by CI (AISDLC-214)
#      per RFC-0042 Phase 3. The hook does NOT synthesize verdicts for
#      docs-only changesets — it exits 0 as a no-op, same as any other case
#      where the verdict file is absent.
#   4. Idempotency: if `.ai-sdlc/attestations/<head-sha>.dsse.json` already
#      exists at current HEAD, exit 0 (we already signed this commit).
#   5. Invoke the signer (default:
#      `node ai-sdlc-plugin/scripts/sign-attestation.mjs`; overridable via
#      AI_SDLC_SIGN_ATTESTATION_CMD for tests).
#   6. Stage + commit the new envelope as a chore commit (no --no-verify is
#      needed: husky's pre-commit + commit-msg hooks pass on the chore body
#      because it carries no CI-skip tokens; we DO bypass commit-msg+pre-commit
#      via `git commit --no-verify` to avoid re-entrant lint-staged on a
#      one-file generated commit, which is consistent with the AISDLC-87
#      CI-side attestor's chore-commit pattern).
#   7. Exit 1 with a clear "re-push required" message: the new commit is local
#      only; the operator (or wrapping `git push` retry) must invoke `git push`
#      again to send it. The next push will skip step 5 entirely (idempotent
#      check at step 4 sees the attestation already exists for HEAD).
#
# Activation: invoked from `.husky/pre-push` AFTER the coverage gate. Wiring
# is in `.husky/pre-push` itself.
#
# Override:
#   AI_SDLC_SKIP_ATTESTATION_SIGN=1 git push
# Use only when deferring sign for operator hand-resign — the verifier will
# mark the resulting PR "invalid (missing)" until an attestation lands.
#
# Test override:
#   AI_SDLC_SIGN_ATTESTATION_CMD="<command>" — overrides the signer invocation
#   so tests can stub it without needing the orchestrator built. The override
#   is invoked with the same args the real signer accepts and is responsible
#   for writing `.ai-sdlc/attestations/<head-sha>.dsse.json`.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — nothing to sign (no sentinel, no verdict, or already attested), or
#       AI_SDLC_SKIP_ATTESTATION_SIGN=1 short-circuit.
#   1 — signed + committed an attestation; push aborted; operator must
#       re-run `git push` to send the new chore commit.
#   2 — signer invocation itself failed (refuses to abort the push silently).

# itself when there's only one commit). Any `.dsse.json` file in
# `.ai-sdlc/attestations/` whose basename (without `.dsse.json`) is NOT

# re-runs `git push`. Normally the second push hits the envelope-exists
# idempotency check above and short-circuits cleanly.
#
# But there's a window where it doesn't: if the operator amends, rebases,
# or otherwise rewrites HEAD between the two pushes such that the
# attestation file moves but the chore-commit subject line stays in place,
# the envelope-at-HEAD check misses and the hook re-fires — signing a
# second envelope on top, adding another chore commit, and looping forever
# until the operator escapes with AI_SDLC_SKIP_ATTESTATION_SIGN=1.
#
# Reproduction: PR #168 cycled twice on AISDLC-115.6 before the operator
# broke the loop manually.
#
# Defense: if HEAD's commit subject line is itself the auto-sign chore
# we just produced, treat it as a "second push of the same cycle" and
# fall through with exit 0. The next dev commit on top will not match
# this prefix and the hook will fire normally.
