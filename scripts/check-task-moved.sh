# AISDLC-220: Auto-move backlog task file to completed/ in the originating PR's
# pre-push hook when the commit subject contains (AISDLC-N). This removes the
# need for the retired `.github/workflows/backlog-task-complete.yml` workflow
# (which created orphan chore PRs after merge per the "mechanical → hook, never
# workflow" pattern).
#
# Why this exists: `backlog-task-complete.yml` created a separate follow-up PR
# to move the task file after every code PR merged. This split a single logical
# change across two PRs, and GITHUB_TOKEN-pushed PRs don't fire CI or trigger
# auto-enable-auto-merge — producing orphan PRs that never auto-merged.
#
# Behaviour:
#
#   1. Honour AI_SDLC_SKIP_TASK_MOVE=1 (operator deferral / manual move).
#   2. Locate the push range from husky's pre-push args ($1 remote, $2 url) via
#      stdin. Parse lines: `<local-ref> <local-sha> <remote-ref> <remote-sha>`.
#      Fall back to HEAD~1..HEAD if stdin is empty or all-zeros remote SHA.
#   3. Scan every commit subject in the range for `(AISDLC-N)` or `(AISDLC-N.M)`
#      patterns (case-insensitive prefix). For each task ID found:
#      a. Skip if `backlog/completed/aisdlc-N - *.md` already exists at HEAD
#         (move already on HEAD — idempotent path).
#      b. Skip if `backlog/tasks/aisdlc-N - *.md` does NOT exist (nothing to move).
#      c. Otherwise: invoke `node pipeline-cli/bin/cli-task-complete.mjs AISDLC-N`,
#         stage the moved file, and record it for the chore commit.
#   4. If any moves were staged, create a single
#      `chore: auto-close AISDLC-N1[, AISDLC-N2 ...] (AISDLC-220)` commit
#      and exit 1 with a clear "re-run git push" message.
#   5. If all tasks were already moved (or nothing to move), exit 0.
#
# Activation: invoked from `.husky/pre-push` AFTER the coverage gate and
# BEFORE the attestation-sign gate. Order is load-bearing (see AISDLC-220 AC
# #2): attestation's contentHashV4 binds {path, headBlobSha} per file. If the
# task move happens AFTER attestation sign, the envelope hashes the OLD path
# (`backlog/tasks/…`) but the actual PR diff contains the NEW path
# (`backlog/completed/…`) — verify-attestation will reject the envelope.
# Order in `.husky/pre-push`: check-coverage.sh → check-task-moved.sh →
# check-attestation-sign.sh.
#
# Override:
#   AI_SDLC_SKIP_TASK_MOVE=1 git push
# Use only when deferring the move for a manual git mv (e.g. operator wants
# to control exactly which commit the move lands in).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — nothing to move (no matching task IDs, or all already in completed/),
#       or AI_SDLC_SKIP_TASK_MOVE=1 short-circuit.
#   1 — moved one or more task files + committed the chore; push aborted;
#       operator must re-run `git push` to send the new chore commit.
#   2 — cli-task-complete invocation failed or post-move integrity error.
